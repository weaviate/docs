Welcome to the Weaviate documentation contributor guide! Whether you're fixing typos, adding new tutorials, or improving existing content, this section provides everything you need to contribute effectively to our documentation.

Our documentation is built with Docusaurus and includes comprehensive guides, API references, tutorials, and examples. Your contributions help thousands of developers understand and use Weaviate more effectively.

## Quickstart

   - Users should fork the repository
   - Weaviate employees don't need to fork the repo and should create a new branch
2. **Set up your local environment** following our [development guide](./development.mdx)
3. **Make your changes** in accordance with our [style guidelines](./style-guide.mdx)
4. **Test locally** with `yarn build` to ensure everything works
