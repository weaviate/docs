このノートブックでは、Crew AI を通じて Weaviate クエリ エージェントをツールとして定義する方法をご紹介します。

## 必要条件
1. Weaviate Cloud インスタンス ( WCD )：Weaviate クエリ エージェントは現時点では WCD でのみ利用できます。サーバーレス クラスターまたは 14 日間無料のサンドボックスを [こちら](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) から作成できます。  
2. `pip install crewai` で Crew AI をインストールします。  
3. `pip install weaviate-agents` で Weaviate Agents パッケージをインストールします。  
4. データを含む Weaviate クラスターが必要です。まだお持ちでない場合は、Weaviate ブログをインポートするために [このノートブック](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/integrations/Weaviate-Import-Example.ipynb) をご覧ください。

## Weaviate クエリ エージェントをツールとして定義

```python
class WeaviateQuerySchema(BaseModel):
    """Input for WeaviateQueryAgentTool."""

    query: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="The query to search retrieve relevant information from the Weaviate database. Pass only the query, not the question.",

        Send a query to the database and get the response.

        Args:

        Returns:
            str: The response from the database containing relevant information.
        """

        weaviate_client = weaviate.connect_to_weaviate_cloud(

            auth_credentials=weaviate.auth.AuthApiKey(os.getenv("WEAVIATE_API_KEY")),
        )
        query_agent = QueryAgent(
            client=weaviate_client,
            collections=[
                "Blogs" # we are using the Weaviate Embeddings for our Blogs collection
            ],
        )
        runner = query_agent.run(query)
        print("runner", runner)
        return runner.final_answer

    def _run(self, query: str) -> str:
        return self.send_query_agent_request(query)
    

query_agent_tool = WeaviateQueryAgentTool()
```

### 

```python
researcher = Agent(
    role="Blog Content Researcher",
    goal="Find relevant blog posts and extract key information",
    backstory="You're specialized in analyzing blog content to extract insights and answers",
    verbose=True,
    tools=[query_agent_tool]
)
```

```python
research_task = Task(
    description="Research blog posts about packaging software applications with Docker",
    expected_output="A summary of key information from relevant blog posts",
    agent=researcher
)
```

```python
blog_crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher],
    tasks=[research_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=True
)
```

## クエリの実行

```python
result = blog_crew.kickoff()

print(result)
```

Python output:

# Agent: Blog Content Researcher
## Thought: I need to find relevant blog posts about packaging software applications with Docker. I will formulate a query to search for this topic in the Weaviate database.
## Using tool: Weaviate Query Agent
## Tool Input: 
"{\"query\": \"packaging software applications with Docker\"}"
## Tool Output: 
Docker is a platform that uses OS-level virtualization to package software applications in units called containers. These containers are similar to lightweight virtual machines, possessing their own file systems and operating system libraries, yet sharing the host system's kernel. Containers are beneficial for software application packaging as they provide considerable isolation with reduced overhead compared to traditional virtual machines. 

A standard Docker practice is to package a single application per container, with the container's lifecycle managed by the application's main process. If this process ends, the container typically stops. This approach ensures applications run in isolation with a consistent environment across different systems.

Docker Compose is often used in parallel with Docker to manage multi-container applications. It allows developers to define and run multi-container Docker applications in a single file, making it easier to manage complex applications that consist of multiple interacting services.

## Final Answer: 
Docker is a platform that uses OS-level virtualization to package software applications in units called containers.
