**[Vector indexes](../../concepts/indexing/vector-index.md)** facilitate efficient, vector-first data storage and retrieval.
There are three supported vector index types:

- **[HNSW index](#hnsw-index)**
- **[Flat index](#flat-index)**
- **[Dynamic index](#dynamic-index)**

## Index configuration parameters

:::caution Experimental feature
Available starting in `v1.25`. Dynamic indexing is an experimental feature. Use with caution.
:::

Use these parameters to configure the index type and their properties. They can be set in the [collection configuration](../../manage-collections/vector-config.mdx#set-vector-index-type).

| Parameter           | Type   | Default | Details                                                              |
| :------------------ | :----- | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vectorIndexType`   | string | `hnsw`  | Optional. The index type - can be `hnsw`, `flat` or `dynamic`.       |
| `vectorIndexConfig` | object | -       | Optional. Set parameters that are specific to the vector index type. |

<details>
  <summary>How to select the index type</summary>

Generally, the `hnsw` index type is recommended for most use cases. The `flat` index type is recommended for use cases where the data the number of objects per index is low, such as in multi-tenancy cases. You can also opt for the `dynamic` index which will initially configure a `flat` index and once the object count exceeds a specified threshold it will automatically convert to an `hnsw` index.

See [this section](../../concepts/indexing/vector-index.md#which-vector-index-is-right-for-me) for more information about the different index types and how to choose between them.

If faster import speeds are desired, [asynchronous indexing](#asynchronous-indexing) allows de-coupling of indexing from object creation.

## HNSW index

HNSW indexes are scalable and super fast at query time, but HNSW algorithms are costly when you add data during the index building process.

### HNSW index parameters

Some HNSW parameters are mutable, but others cannot be modified after you create your collection.

| Parameter                | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Default    | Mutable |
| :----------------------- | :------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :------ |
| `cleanupIntervalSeconds` | integer | Cleanup frequency. This value does not normally need to be adjusted. A higher value means cleanup runs less frequently, but it does more in a single batch. A lower value means cleanup is more frequent, but it may be less efficient on each run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 300        | Yes     |
| `distance`               | string  | Distance metric. The metric that measures the distance between two arbitrary vectors. For available distance metrics, see [supported distance metrics](/weaviate/config-refs/distances.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | `cosine`   | No      |
| `ef`                     | integer | Balance search speed and recall. `ef` is the size of the dynamic list that the HNSW uses during search. Search is more accurate when `ef` is higher, but it is also slower. `ef` values greater than 512 show diminishing improvements in recall.<br/><br/>Dynamic `ef`. Weaviate automatically adjusts the `ef` value and creates a dynamic `ef` list when `ef` is set to -1. For more details, see [dynamic ef](../../concepts/indexing/vector-index.md#dynamic-ef). | -1         | Yes     |
| `efConstruction`         | integer | Balance index search speed and build speed. A high `efConstruction` value means you can lower your `ef` settings, but importing is slower.<br/><br/>`efConstruction` must be greater than 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 128        | No      |
| `maxConnections`         | integer | Maximum number of connections per element. `maxConnections` is the connection limit per layer for layers above the zero layer. The zero layer can have (2 \* `maxConnections`) connections. <br/><br/> `maxConnections` must be greater than 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 32         | No      |
| `dynamicEfMin`           | integer | Lower bound for [dynamic `ef`](../../concepts/indexing/vector-index.md#dynamic-ef). Protects against a creating search list that is too short.<br/><br/>This setting is only used when `ef` is -1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 100        | Yes     |
| `dynamicEfMax`           | integer | Upper bound for [dynamic `ef`](../../concepts/indexing/vector-index.md#dynamic-ef). Protects against creating a search list that is too long. <br/><br/>If `dynamicEfMax` is higher than the limit, `dynamicEfMax` does not have any effect. In this case, `ef` is the limit.<br/><br/>This setting is only used when `ef` is -1.                                                                                                                                      | 500        | Yes     |
| `dynamicEfFactor`        | integer | Multiplier for [dynamic `ef`](../../concepts/indexing/vector-index.md#dynamic-ef). Sets the potential length of the search list. <br/><br/>This setting is only used when `ef` is -1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 8          | Yes     |
| `filterStrategy`         | string  | Added in `v1.27.0`. The filter strategy to use for filtering the search results. The filter strategy can be set to `sweeping` or `acorn`. <br/><br/> - `sweeping`: The default filter strategy. <br/> - `acorn`: Uses Weaviate's ACORN implementation.

| `flatSearchCutoff`       | integer | Optional. Threshold for the [flat-search cutoff](/weaviate/concepts/filtering.md#flat-search-cutoff). To force a vector index search, set `"flatSearchCutoff": 0`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 40000      | Yes     |
| `skip`                   | boolean | When true, do not index the collection. <br/><br/> Weaviate decouples vector creation and vector storage. If you skip vector indexing, but a vectorizer is configured (or a vector is provided manually), Weaviate logs a warning each import. <br/><br/> To skip indexing and vector generation, set `"vectorizer": "none"` when you set `"skip": true`. <br/><br/> See [When to skip indexing](../../concepts/indexing/vector-index.md#when-to-skip-indexing).       | `false`    | No      |
| `vectorCacheMaxObjects`  | integer | Maximum number of objects in the memory cache. By default, this limit is set to one trillion (`1e12`) objects when a new collection is created. For sizing recommendations, see [Vector cache considerations](../../concepts/indexing/vector-index.md#vector-cache-considerations).                                                                                                                                                                                    | `1e12`     | Yes     |

### Database parameters for HNSW

Note that some database-level parameters are available to configure HNSW indexing behavior.

- [`PERSISTENCE_HNSW_MAX_LOG_SIZE`](/deploy/configuration/env-vars/index.md#PERSISTENCE_HNSW_MAX_LOG_SIZE) is a database-level parameter that sets the maximum size of the HNSW write-ahead-log. The default value is `500MiB`.

  Increase this value to improve efficiency of the compaction process, but be aware that this will increase the memory usage of the database. Conversely, decreasing this value will reduce memory usage but may slow down the compaction process.

  Preferably, the `PERSISTENCE_HNSW_MAX_LOG_SIZE` should set to a value close to the size of the HNSW graph.

- [`DEFAULT_QUANTIZATION`](/deploy/configuration/env-vars/index.md#DEFAULT_QUANTIZATION) is a database-level parameter that defines which quantization technique will be used by default when creating new collections. 

### Tombstone cleanup parameters

:::info Environment variable availability

- `TOMBSTONE_DELETION_CONCURRENCY` is available in `v1.24.0` and up.
- `TOMBSTONE_DELETION_MIN_PER_CYCLE` and `TOMBSTONE_DELETION_MAX_PER_CYCLE` are available in `v1.24.15` / `v1.25.2` and up.

:::

Tombstones are records that mark deleted objects. In an HNSW index, tombstones are regularly cleaned up, triggered periodically by the `cleanupIntervalSeconds` parameter.

As the index grows in size, the cleanup process may take longer to complete and require more resources. For very large indexes, this may cause performance issues.

To control the number of tombstones deleted per cleanup cycle and prevent performance issues, set the [`TOMBSTONE_DELETION_MAX_PER_CYCLE` and `TOMBSTONE_DELETION_MIN_PER_CYCLE` environment variables](/deploy/configuration/env-vars/index.md#general).

- Set `TOMBSTONE_DELETION_MIN_PER_CYCLE` to prevent occurrences of unnecessary cleanup cycles.
- Set `TOMBSTONE_DELETION_MAX_PER_CYCLE` to prevent the cleanup process from taking too long and consuming too many resources.

As an example, for a cluster with 300 million objects per shard, a `TOMBSTONE_DELETION_MIN_PER_CYCLE` value of 1000000 (1 million) and a `TOMBSTONE_DELETION_MAX_PER_CYCLE` value of 10000000 (10 million) may be good starting points.

You can also set the `TOMBSTONE_DELETION_CONCURRENCY` environment variable to limit the number of threads used for tombstone cleanup. This can help prevent prevent the cleanup process from unnecessarily consuming too many resources, or the cleanup process from taking too long.

The default value for `TOMBSTONE_DELETION_CONCURRENCY` is set to half the number of CPU cores available to Weaviate.

In a cluster with a large number of cores, you may want to set `TOMBSTONE_DELETION_CONCURRENCY` to a lower value to prevent the cleanup process from consuming too many resources. Conversely, in a cluster with a small number of cores and a large number of deletions, you may want to set `TOMBSTONE_DELETION_CONCURRENCY` to a higher value to speed up the cleanup process.

### HNSW Configuration tips

To determine reasonable settings for your use case, consider the following questions and compare your answers in the table below:

1. How many queries do you expect per second?
1. Do you expect a lot of imports or updates?
1. How high should the recall be?

| Number of queries | Many imports or updates | Recall level | Configuration suggestions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| not many          | no                      | low          | This is the ideal scenario. Keep both the `ef` and `efConstruction` settings low. You don't need a big machine and you will still be happy with the results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Dynamic index

:::caution Experimental feature
Available starting in `v1.25`. Dynamic indexing is an experimental feature. Use with caution.
:::

import DynamicAsyncRequirements from "/_includes/dynamic-index-async-req.mdx";

<DynamicAsyncRequirements />

Using the `dynamic` index will initially create a flat index and once the number of objects exceeds a certain threshold (by default 10,000 objects) it will automatically switch you over to an HNSW index.

This is only a one-way switch that converts a flat index to a HNSW, the index does not support changing back to a flat index even if the object count goes below the threshold due to deletion.

The goal of `dynamic` indexing is to shorten latencies during query time at the cost of a larger memory footprint.

### Dynamic index parameters

## Default quantization for new collections {#default-quantization}

:::info Added in `v1.33`
:::

Starting with Weaviate v1.33, **[8-bit Rotational Quantization (RQ)](../../configuration/compression/rq-compression.md) is enabled by default for all new collections**. This automatic optimization provides up to 4x memory compression and faster query performance while maintaining high recall accuracy. Existing collections (for example restored from backups) are not affected and retain their original configuration.

Set the [`DEFAULT_QUANTIZATION` environment variable](/docs/deploy/configuration/env-vars/index.md#DEFAULT_QUANTIZATION) before starting Weaviate to change the default quantization technique or to disable it.

## Configure semantic indexing

Weaviate can generate vector embeddings for objects using [model provider integrations](/weaviate/model-providers/).

For instance, text embedding integrations (e.g. `text2vec-cohere` for Cohere, or `text2vec-ollama` for Ollama) can generate vectors from text objects. Weaviate follows the collection configuration and a set of predetermined rules to vectorize objects.

Unless specified otherwise in the collection definition, the default behavior is to:

- Only vectorize properties that use the `text` or `text[]` data type (unless [skipped](../../manage-collections/vector-config.mdx#property-level-settings))
- Sort properties in alphabetical (a-z) order before concatenating values
- If `vectorizePropertyName` is `true` (`false` by default) prepend the property name to each property value
- Join the (prepended) property values with spaces
- Prepend the class name (unless `vectorizeClassName` is `false`)
- Convert the produced string to lowercase

For example, this data object,

```js
Article = {
  summary: "Cows lose their jobs as milk prices drop",
  text: "As his 100 diary cows lumbered over for their Monday...",
};
```

will be vectorized as:

```md
article cows lose their jobs as milk prices drop as his 100 diary cows lumbered over for their monday...
```

By default, the calculation includes the collection name and all property values, but the property names are not indexed.

To configure vectorization behavior on a per-collection basis, use `vectorizeClassName`.

To configure vectorization on a per-property basis, use `skip` and `vectorizePropertyName`.

## Asynchronous indexing

To enable asynchronous indexing, set the `ASYNC_INDEXING` environment variable to `true` in your Weaviate configuration (the `docker-compose.yml` file if you use Docker Compose). This setting enables asynchronous indexing for all collections.

<details>
  <summary>Example Docker Compose configuration</summary>

      CLUSTER_HOSTNAME: "node1"
      AUTOSCHEMA_ENABLED: "false"
      ASYNC_INDEXING: "true"
```

</details>

To get the index status, check the [node status](/deploy/configuration/nodes.md) endpoint.

<details>
  <summary><code>Node status</code> example usage</summary>

The `nodes/shards/vectorQueueLength` field shows the number of objects that still have to be indexed.

import Nodes from "/_includes/code/nodes.mdx";

<Nodes />

Then, you can check the status of the vector index queue by inspecting the output.

<br />

The `vectorQueueLength` field will show the number of remaining objects to be indexed. In the example below, the vector index queue has 425 objects remaining to be indexed on the `TestArticle` shard, out of a total of 1000 objects.

```json
{
  "nodes": [
