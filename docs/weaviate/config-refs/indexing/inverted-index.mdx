The **[inverted index](../../concepts/indexing/inverted-index.md)** maps values (like words or numbers) to the objects that contain them. It is the backbone for all attribute-based filtering (`where` filters) and keyword searching (`bm25`, `hybrid`).

## Inverted index types

Multiple [inverted index types](../../concepts/indexing/inverted-index.md) are available in Weaviate. Not all inverted index types are available for all data types. The available inverted index types are:

import InvertedIndexTypesSummary from "/_includes/inverted-index-types-summary.mdx";

<InvertedIndexTypesSummary />

- Enable one or both of `indexFilterable` and `indexRangeFilters` to index a property for faster filtering.
  - If only one is enabled, the respective index is used for filtering.
  - If both are enabled, `indexRangeFilters` is used for operations involving comparison operators, and `indexFilterable` is used for equality and inequality operations.

## Inverted index parameters

These parameters are set within the `invertedIndexConfig` object in your collection definition.

| Parameter                                     | Type    | Default                    | Details                                                                                                                                              |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :------ | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`bm25`](#bm25)                               | Object  | `{ "k1": 1.2, "b": 0.75 }` | Sets the `k1` and `b` parameters for the BM25 ranking algorithm. Can be overridden at the property level. See [**BM25 Configuration**](#bm25) below. |
| [`stopwords`](#stopwords)                     | Object  | (Varies)                   | Defines the stopword list to exclude common words from search queries. See [**Stopwords Configuration**](#stopwords) below.                          |
| [`indexTimestamps`](#indextimestamps)         | Boolean | `false`                    | If `true`, indexes object creation and update timestamps, enabling filtering by `creationTimeUnix` and `lastUpdateTimeUnix`.                         |
| [`indexNullState`](#indexnullstate)           | Boolean | `false`                    | If `true`, indexes the null/non-null state of each property, enabling filtering for `null` values.                                                   |
| [`indexPropertyLength`](#indexpropertylength) | Boolean | `false`                    | If `true`, indexes the length of each property, enabling filtering by property length.                                                               |

:::caution Performance Impact
Enabling `indexTimestamps`, `indexNullState`, or `indexPropertyLength` adds overhead as these additional indexes must be created and maintained. Only enable them if you require these specific filtering capabilities.

#### Code example

This code example shows how to configure inverted index parameters through a client library:

<Tabs className="code" groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCode}
      startMarker="# START SetInvertedIndexParams"
      endMarker="# END SetInvertedIndexParams"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>

<TabItem value="ts" label="JavaScript/TypeScript">
  <FilteredTextBlock
    text={TSCode}
    startMarker="// START SetInvertedIndexParams"
    endMarker="// END SetInvertedIndexParams"
    language="ts"
  />
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">
  <FilteredTextBlock
    text={JavaCode}
    startMarker="// START SetInvertedIndexParams"
    endMarker="// END SetInvertedIndexParams"
    language="java"
  />
</TabItem>

  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={GoCode}
      startMarker="// START SetInvertedIndexParams"
      endMarker="// END SetInvertedIndexParams"
      language="gonew"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### `bm25`

Part of `invertedIndexConfig`. The settings for BM25 are the [free parameters `k1` and `b`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25#The_ranking_function), and they are optional. The defaults (`k1` = 1.2 and `b` = 0.75) work well for most cases.

They can be configured per collection, and can optionally be overridden per property.

<details>
  <summary>Example `bm25` configuration -  JSON object</summary>

An example of a complete collection object with `bm25` configuration:

```json
{
  "class": "Article",
  // Configuration of the sparse index
  "invertedIndexConfig": {
    "bm25": {
      "b": 0.75,
      "k1": 1.2
    }
  },
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "title",
      "description": "title of the article",
      "dataType": ["text"],
      // Property-level settings override the collection-level settings
      "invertedIndexConfig": {
        "bm25": {
          "b": 0.75,
          "k1": 1.2
        }
      },
      "indexFilterable": true,
      "indexSearchable": true
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

#### `stopwords`

Part of `invertedIndexConfig`. `text` properties may contain words that are very common and don't contribute to search results. Ignoring them speeds up queries that contain stopwords, as they can be automatically removed from queries as well. This speedup is very notable on scored searches, such as `BM25`.

The stopword configuration uses a preset system. You can select a preset to use the most common stopwords for a particular language (e.g. [`"en"` preset](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/blob/main/adapters/repos/db/inverted/stopwords/presets.go)). If you need more fine-grained control, you can add additional stopwords or remove stopwords that you believe should not be part of the list. Alternatively, you can create your custom stopword list by starting with an empty (`"none"`) preset and adding all your desired stopwords as additions.

<details>
  <summary>Example `stopwords` configuration -  JSON object</summary>

An example of a complete collection object with `stopwords` configuration:

```json
  "invertedIndexConfig": {
    "stopwords": {
      "preset": "en",
      "additions": ["star", "nebula"],
      "removals": ["a", "the"]
    }
  }
```

</details>

This configuration allows stopwords to be configured by collection. If not set, these values are set to the following defaults:

| Parameter     | Default value | Acceptable values          |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `"preset"`    | `"en"`        | `"en"`, `"none"`           |
| `"additions"` | `[]`          | _any list of custom words_ |
| `"removals"`  | `[]`          | _any list of custom words_ |

:::note

- If `preset` is `none`, then the collection only uses stopwords from the `additions` list.
- If the same item is included in both `additions` and `removals`, Weaviate returns an error.
  :::

As of `v1.18`, stopwords are indexed. Thus stopwords are included in the inverted index, but not in the tokenized query. As a result, when the BM25 algorithm is applied, stopwords are ignored in the input for relevance ranking but will affect the score.

Stopwords can now be configured at runtime. You can use the RESTful API to <SkipLink href="/weaviate/api/rest#tag/schema/put/schema/%7BclassName%7D">update</SkipLink> the list of stopwords after your data has been indexed.

:::info

Stopwords are only removed when [tokenization](../collections.mdx#tokenization) is set to `word`.

:::

#### `indexTimestamps`

Part of `invertedIndexConfig`. To perform queries that are filtered by timestamps, configure the target collection to maintain an inverted index based on the objects' internal timestamps. Currently the timestamps include `creationTimeUnix` and `lastUpdateTimeUnix`.

To configure timestamp based indexing, set `indexTimestamps` to `true` in the `invertedIndexConfig` object.

#### `indexNullState`

Part of `invertedIndexConfig`. To perform queries that filter on `null`, configure the target collection to maintain an inverted index that tracks `null` values for each property in a collection .

To configure `null` based indexing, setting `indexNullState` to `true` in the `invertedIndexConfig` object.

#### `indexPropertyLength`

Part of `invertedIndexConfig`. To perform queries that filter by the length of a property, configure the target collection to maintain an inverted index based on the length of the properties.

To configure indexing based on property length, set `indexPropertyLength` to `true` in the `invertedIndexConfig` object.

:::note
Using these features requires more resources. The additional inverted indexes must be created and maintained for the lifetime of the collection.

## How Weaviate creates inverted indexes

Weaviate creates **separate inverted indexes for each property and each index type**. For example, if you have a `title` property that is both searchable and filterable,
Weaviate will create two separate inverted indexes for that property - one optimized for search operations and another for filtering operations.
Find out more in [Concepts: Inverted index](../../concepts/indexing/inverted-index.md#how-weaviate-creates-inverted-indexes).

### Adding a property after collection creation

Adding a property after importing objects can lead to limitations in inverted-index related behavior, such as filtering by the new property's length or null status.

This is caused by the inverted index being built at import time. If you add a property after importing objects, the inverted index for metadata such as the length or the null status will not be updated to include the new properties. This means that the new property will not be indexed for existing objects. This can lead to unexpected behavior when querying.

To avoid this, you can either:

- Add the property before importing objects.
- Delete the collection, re-create it with the new property and then re-import the data.

We are working on a re-indexing API to allow you to re-index the data after adding a property. This will be available in a future release.

## How tokenization affects inverted indexing

For `text` properties, Weaviate first **[tokenizes](../collections.mdx#tokenization)** the text before creating inverted index entries. Tokenization is the process of breaking text into individual tokens (words, phrases, or characters) that can be indexed and searched.

The tokenization method you choose directly impacts:

- What tokens are created from your text
- How these tokens are stored in the inverted index
- How search queries and filters match against your data

For example, with the text `"Hello, (beautiful) world"`:

- **`word` tokenization** creates tokens: `["hello", "beautiful", "world"]`
- **`whitespace` tokenization** creates tokens: `["hello", "(beautiful)", "world"]`
- **`field` tokenization** creates a single token: `["Hello, (beautiful) world"]`

Each token becomes a separate entry in the inverted index, pointing back to the objects containing that token.

:::tip

Different tokenization methods suit different use cases. Use `word` (default) for general text search, `field` for exact matching, or specialized tokenizers like `gse` or `kagome_ja` for Asian languages. Learn more about [tokenization options](../collections.mdx#tokenization).
