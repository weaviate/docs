The **Weaviate Docs MCP Server** brings instant access to Weaviate's documentation directly into your AI development environment. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), this server integrates seamlessly with tools like Claude Desktop and Cursor, allowing you to query Weaviate's documentation without leaving your IDE.

The MCP server uses [kapa.ai](https://kapa.ai) (which in turn uses Weaviate under the hood) as its knowledge engine, which powers the search and retrieval of Weaviate documentation. The server offers:

- **Instant documentation access**: Search Weaviate docs without context switching.
- **Multi-source knowledge base**: Queries across docs, tutorials, API references, GitHub issues and community content.
- **Always up-to-date**: Automatically syncs with the latest Weaviate documentation.

## How-to setup Docs MCP Server

Here you can find instructions on how to connect to the Docs MCP Server from Claude Desktop and Cursor. For other platforms, consult their respective documentation (for example, [ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/mcp), [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp)).

### Claude Desktop

1. Locate your Claude Desktop configuration file, usually located here:

   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the Weaviate MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weaviate-docs": {
      "url": "https://weaviate-docs-mcp.netlify.app/mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop.

4. Look for the **Weaviate Docs** option under the _Search and tools_ section in Claude Desktop to confirm the server is connected.

### Cursor

1. Open Cursor settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,).

2. Navigate to **Features** → **Model Context Protocol**,

3. Add the server URL:

```
https://weaviate-docs-mcp.netlify.app/mcp-server
```

4. Restart Cursor.

## Using the MCP Server

### In Claude Desktop

Once configured, you can interact with Weaviate documentation naturally:

**Example queries:**

```
"How do I set up a hybrid search in Weaviate?"

"What are the best practices for schema design in Weaviate?"

"Search the Weaviate docs for information about BM25 algorithm"

"What's the difference between vector and keyword search in Weaviate?"
```

Claude will automatically use the MCP server to search the documentation and provide cited answers.

### In Cursor

While coding, you can ask Cursor to reference Weaviate documentation. Here's a typical workflow using the MCP server:

1. **You're coding a Weaviate integration in Cursor**

   ```python
   import weaviate

   # How do I set up authentication?
   ```

2. **Ask Cursor**: "Search Weaviate docs for authentication setup with Python client".

3. **MCP Server queries kapa.ai**, which searches the Weaviate documentation using semantic search.

4. **You receive** a detailed answer with code examples and links to relevant docs.
