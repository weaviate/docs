Weaviate is an open-source vector database built to power AI applications, from prototypes to production-scale systems. This guide will show you how to connect to a local Weaviate instance, import data, vectorize objects and perform searches.

There are two paths you can choose from:

<CardsSection items={quickstartOptions} className={styles.smallCards} />
<br />

<Tabs groupId="import" queryString="import" className="hidden-tabs">
<TabItem value="vectorization" label="Vectorize objects during import">

This quickstart guide will show you how to:

1. **Create a collection & import data** - Create a collection and import data into it. The data will be vectorized with the <Tooltip content="Embedding models are models that are trained specifically to generate vector embeddings: long arrays of numbers that represent semantic meaning for a given object." position="top"><span style={{ textDecoration: "underline", cursor: "help" }}>Ollama embedding model</span></Tooltip> service. You are also free to use any other available [embedding model provider](../model-providers/index.md).
2. **Search** - Perform a similarity (vector) search on your data using a text query. 
3. **RAG** - Perform Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with a generative model.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="custom-embeddings" label="Import vectors">

This quickstart guide will show you how to:

1. **Create a collection & import data**- Create a collection and import data into it. The data should already contain the <Tooltip content="Vector embeddings generated by an embedding model (from a provider like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)." position="top"><span style={{ textDecoration: "underline", cursor: "help" }}>pre-computed vector embeddings</span></Tooltip>. This option is useful for when you are migrating data from a different vector database.
2. **Search** - Perform a similarity (vector) search on your data using a vector query.
3. **RAG** - Perform Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with a generative model.

If you encounter any issues along the way or have additional questions, use the <KapaAI>Ask AI</KapaAI> feature.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) on your machine.
We will be running Weaviate and Ollama language models locally. We recommend that you use a modern computer with at least 8GB of RAM, preferably 16GB or more.

---

## Start Weaviate and Ollama with Docker Compose

Save the following code to a file named `docker-compose.yml` in your project directory.

```yaml
services:
  weaviate:
    command:
    - --host
    - 0.0.0.0
    - --port
    - '8080'
    - --scheme
    - http
    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:||site.weaviate_version||
    ports:
    - 8080:8080
    - 50051:50051
    volumes:
    - weaviate_data:/var/lib/weaviate
    restart: on-failure:0
    environment:
      QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT: 25
      AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED: 'true'
      PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH: '/var/lib/weaviate'
      ENABLE_MODULES: 'text2vec-ollama,generative-ollama'
      CLUSTER_HOSTNAME: 'node1'
      OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT: 'http://ollama:11434'
    depends_on:
      - ollama

  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:0.12.9
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"
    volumes:
      - ollama_data:/root/.ollama
    environment:
      - OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0
    command: >
      sh -c "
        ollama serve &
        PID=$!
        sleep 5
        ollama pull nomic-embed-text
        ollama pull llama3
        wait $PID
      "

volumes:
  weaviate_data:
  ollama_data:
```

Run the following command to start a Weaviate instance and Ollama using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Install a client library

Follow the instructions below to install one of the official client libraries, available in [Python](../client-libraries/python/index.mdx), [JavaScript/TypeScript](../client-libraries/typescript/index.mdx), [Go](../client-libraries/go.md), and [Java](../client-libraries/java.md).

import CodeClientInstall from "/_includes/code/quickstart/clients.install.new.mdx";

<CodeClientInstall />

## Step 1: Create a collection & import data {#create-a-collection}

<Tabs groupId="import" queryString="import" className="hidden-tabs">
<TabItem value="vectorization" label="Vectorize objects during import">

The following example creates a collection called `Movie` with the [Ollama](../model-providers/ollama/embeddings.md) embedding model provider (`text2vec-ollama`) for vectorizing data during import and for querying.

import CreateCollection from "/_includes/code/quickstart/quickstart.short.local.create_collection.mdx";

<CreateCollection />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="custom-embeddings" label="Import vectors">

The following example creates a collection called `Movie` and imports pre-computed vectors along with the movie data. We will define the collection properties explicitly, but you can also use the [auto-schema](../config-refs/collections.mdx#auto-schema) feature to infer the data schema automatically.

import CreateCollectionCustomVectors from "/_includes/code/quickstart/quickstart.short.local.import_vectors.create_collection.mdx";

<CreateCollectionCustomVectors />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Semantic (vector) search {#semantic-search}

<Tabs groupId="import" queryString="import" className="hidden-tabs">
<TabItem value="vectorization" label="Vectorize objects during import">

Semantic search finds results based on meaning. This is called `nearText` in Weaviate. The following example searches for 2 objects (_limit_) whose meaning is most similar to that of `sci-fi`.

import QueryNearText from "/_includes/code/quickstart/quickstart.short.local.query.neartext.mdx";

<QueryNearText />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="custom-embeddings" label="Import vectors">

Semantic search finds results based on meaning. This is called `nearVector` in Weaviate. The following example searches for 2 objects (_limit_) whose vector is most similar to the query vector.

import QueryNearVectorImportVectors from "/_includes/code/quickstart/quickstart.short.local.import_vectors.query.nearvector.mdx";

<QueryNearVectorImportVectors />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip Weaviate Agents

Try the [Query Agent](/agents/query/index.md) with a Weaviate Cloud instance. You simply provide a prompt/question in natural language, and the Query Agent takes care of all the needed steps to provide an answer.

## Step 3: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)

<Tabs groupId="import" queryString="import" className="hidden-tabs">
<TabItem value="vectorization" label="Vectorize objects during import">

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG), also called generative search, works by prompting a large language model (LLM) with a combination of a _user query_ and _data retrieved from a database_.

The following example combines the semantic search for the query `sci-fi` with a prompt to generate a tweet.

import QueryRAG from "/_includes/code/quickstart/quickstart.short.local.query.rag.mdx";

<QueryRAG />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="custom-embeddings" label="Import vectors">
