## How collections work

A Weaviate collection is defined by several core components and settings that enable data storage and vector search.  
Key elements include:

import CollectionsSimplified from "/docs/weaviate/manage-collections/img/weaviate-collections-simplified.png";
import Link from "@docusaurus/Link";

export const textColumnContent = (
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Objects</b>:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The fundamental units stored within a collection. Each object contains
          data properties and includes vector embeddings representing its
          meaning. (See the{" "}
          <Link to="/weaviate/manage-objects">
            'How-to: Manage objects' guide
          </Link>{" "}
          for more details on manipulating objects).
