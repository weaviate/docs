title: Securing Weaviate with SSL/TLS
description: Learn the various techniques to secure your Weaviate deployment and go from Zero to Hero!
---

## Why security matters: Understanding the risks

When your Weaviate database is exposed to the internet, unencrypted connections create serious vulnerabilities. Network packets can be intercepted at various points along their journey, exposing:

- **Sensitive queries and search terms** revealing what data you're working with
- **Vector embeddings and data payloads** containing your proprietary information
- **Authentication credentials** if transmitted without encryption
- **API keys and tokens** that could grant unauthorized access to your systems

That's exactly why it's important to secure your database using **SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security)** — encryption protocols that create a secure, encrypted connection between your clients and your database. SSL/TLS ensures that even if network traffic is intercepted, the data remains unreadable to unauthorized parties.

:::info Managed Weaviate deployments

If you're using **Weaviate Cloud** or other managed Weaviate services, SSL/TLS is already configured and managed for you. This guide is primarily for self-hosted deployments on virtual private servers (VPS), hyperscaler infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure), or on-premises environments where you need to expose Weaviate to external networks.

:::

This guide will take you through three different options for securing your self-hosted database. Whether you're a small startup or an enterprise giant - there's a solution for you!

## When is SSL/TLS required?

#### There are some occasions where encryption is _optional:_

- **Co-located deployments:** Weaviate and your application are in the same protected environment.
- **Internal-only access:** Your traffic never leaves the secure network perimeter.
- **Localhost development:** You are testing on a local machine.

#### While in other occasions encryption is _required:_

Data transmitted over networks is vulnerable to interception. Network packets can be inspected at various points, exposing sensitive queries and vector data.

- **Internet-exposed deployments:** Weaviate accessible from external networks
- **Multi-network architectures:** Application and Weaviate on separate networks
- **Remote client connections:** Mobile apps, external services, or distributed systems

## Understanding Weaviate's dual-port architecture

Before we dive into implementation, it's important to understand that Weaviate requires **two separate endpoints**, both of which need SSL/TLS protection:

| **Port** | **Purpose**                                                    | **Protocol** |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 8080     | REST API and query interface (queries also available via gRPC) | HTTP         |
| 50051    | High-performance data operations and queries                   | gRPC         |

:::info
**Port 6060** is used for Go profiling. In production deployments, this port should typically remain internal and not be exposed to the internet. If you need external access, apply the same SSL/TLS principles but ensure proper authentication is also in place.
:::

This dual-port requirement adds complexity compared to traditional single-port applications, as each endpoint needs its own domain/subdomain and SSL certificate.

## Choosing your security approach

While the possibilities are endless for securing your vector database, this guide walks you through **3 approaches** with varying levels of complexity, cost, and scalability. Here's how to choose:

| **Approach**                            | **Complexity** | **Best for**                                   | **Infrastructure**          | **Key benefits**                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Option 1: Nginx Proxy Manager**       | Novice         | Small teams, personal projects, GUI preference | Docker-based deployments    | Easy GUI configuration, visual certificate management             |
| **Option 2: Traefik**                   | Intermediate   | Growing companies, IaC workflows               | Docker Compose environments | Automated configuration, Infrastructure as Code, container-native |
| **Option 3: Kubernetes + Cert-Manager** | Advanced       | Enterprise, production scale                   | Kubernetes clusters         | Auto-renewal, high availability, enterprise-grade orchestration   |

:::tip **Infrastructure compatibility:**

- **Options 1 & 2** are designed for Docker and Docker Compose deployments
- **Option 3** is exclusively for Kubernetes environments
  :::

---

### Option 1: Using Nginx Proxy Manager

- **Complexity level:** Novice
- **Perfect for:** Small business, teams who prefer ClickOps (GUI-based operations), or personal projects.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker and Docker Compose required. This approach is specifically for Docker-based deployments and is not compatible with Kubernetes.

What you'll need:

- A VPS or server with a public IP address
- A registered domain name with DNS management access
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic command-line knowledge

#### Step 1: Configure your DNS

1. Before requesting SSL certificates, configure your DNS records:

```
A Record:    weaviate.yourdomain.com    → Your-Server-IP
A Record:    grpc.yourdomain.com        → Your-Server-IP
```

:::tip
Use a wildcard DNS record (`*.yourdomain.com`) for easier subdomain management.
:::

Make sure to wait for DNS propagation before proceeding.

#### Step 2: Create your shared Docker network

1. Create a network for secure container communication:

```bash
docker network create weaviate-network
```

:::info
**Security Benefit:** By using a shared Docker network and not exposing Weaviate ports to the host, Weaviate is only accessible through the SSL-secured proxy, never directly from the internet.
:::

#### Step 3: Deploy Weaviate

1. Create a directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir ~/weaviate-ssl
cd ~/weaviate-ssl
```

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file for Weaviate.

```yaml
---
services:
  weaviate:
    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:||site.weaviate_version||
    container_name: weaviate
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - weaviate-network
    environment:
      QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT: 25
      AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED: "false"
      PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH: "/var/lib/weaviate"
      DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE: "none"
      CLUSTER_HOSTNAME: "node1"
    volumes:
      - weaviate_data:/var/lib/weaviate

volumes:
  weaviate_data:

networks:
  weaviate-network:
    external: true
```

3. Start Weaviate:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Verify that it's running:

```bash
# Test from within the Docker network (this should work)
docker exec weaviate curl http://localhost:8080/v1/meta

# Test from host (this should fail - connection refused)
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/meta
```

:::tip
**Expected Result:** The internal test succeeds, but the host test fails.

This confirms Weaviate is only accessible within the Docker network, not from the host or internet.
:::

#### Step 4: Install Nginx Proxy Manager

1. Create a separate directory:

```bash
mkdir ~/nginx-proxy-manager
cd ~/nginx-proxy-manager
```

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: "jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest"
    container_name: nginx-proxy-manager
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - weaviate-network
    ports:
      - "80:80" # HTTP
      - "81:81" # Admin UI
      - "443:443" # HTTPS
    environment:
      DB_SQLITE_FILE: "/data/database.sqlite"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt

networks:
  weaviate-network:
    external: true
```

3. Start Nginx Proxy Manager

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Step 5: Access the admin interface

1. Navigate to `http://your-server-ip:81`

**Default credentials**

```
Email:    admin@example.com
Password: changeme
```

:::danger
Change these credentials **immediately** after first login!
:::

#### Step 6: Secure the HTTP endpoint

1. Click **Hosts** -> **Proxy hosts** -> **Add proxy host**

#### Details Tab

| **Field**             | **Value**                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Domain names          | `weaviate.yourdomain.com` |
| Scheme                | `http`                    |
| Forward Hostname/IP   | `weaviate`                |
| Forward Port          | `8080`                    |
| Cache Assets          | ✅ Checked                |
| Block Common Exploits | ✅ Checked                |
| Websockets Support    | ✅ Checked                |

:::info
**Why "weaviate"?** Docker's internal DNS resolves container names within the same network. Nginx Proxy Manager can reach Weaviate at `http://weaviate:8080` internally through the shared `weaviate-network`.
:::

#### SSL Tab

| **Field**       | **Value**                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| SSL Certificate | Request a new SSL Certificate |
| Force SSL       | ✅ Checked                    |
| HTTP/2 Support  | ✅ Checked                    |
| HSTS Enabled    | ✅ Checked                    |
| Email Address   | `your-email@example.com`      |

2. Agree to the TOS.
3. Click Save and wait 30-60 seconds for certificate provisioning.

#### Step 7: Secure the gRPC endpoints

1. Create a second proxy host for gRPC:

**Details tab**

| **Field**             | **Value**             |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Domain Names          | `grpc.yourdomain.com` |
| Scheme                | `http`                |
| Forward Hostname/IP   | `weaviate`            |
| Forward Port          | `50051`               |
| Block Common Exploits | ✅ Checked            |
| Websockets Support    | ✅ Checked            |

**SSL Tab**
Configure SSL the same way as the [HTTP endpoint](#ssl-tab)

**Advanced Tab** (_Critical for gRPC_)

Add this custom Nginx configuration:

```nginx
grpc_pass grpc://localhost:50051;
grpc_set_header Host $host;
```

Click **Save.**

#### Step 8: Test your secure connection

#### Test from command line

```bash
# Test HTTP endpoint (this should work)
curl https://weaviate.yourdomain.com/v1/meta

# Test direct access (this should fail with a connection refused message)
curl http://your-server-ip:8080/v1/meta

# Verify SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect weaviate.yourdomain.com:443 -servername weaviate.yourdomain.com < /dev/null
```

#### Test with Python client

```python
import weaviate

# Connect to SSL-secured Weaviate
client = weaviate.connect_to_custom(
    http_host="weaviate.yourdomain.com",
    http_port=443,
    http_secure=True,
    grpc_host="grpc.yourdomain.com",
    grpc_port=443,
    grpc_secure=True
)

# Verify connection
print(f"✅ Connected: {client.is_ready()}")

client.close()
```

### Option 2: Using Traefik and Docker

- **Complexity level:** Intermediate
- **Perfect for:** Growing companies, devs who love automation, and container-based infrastructure.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker and Docker Compose required. This approach uses Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles and is designed for Docker environments, not Kubernetes.

This method introduces Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles while remaining manageable. Traefik was built specifically for containerized environments. This approach is the perfect intermediary between the GUI of Option 1 and the pure Kubernetes of Option 3. You can think of this as the progression of learning another language: Option 1 was like using Duolingo or using a translation app, Option 2 is learning to speak the language without the use of a translation app, and Option 3 is becoming fluent.

What you'll need:

- Docker and Docker compose installed
- Domain name with DNS configured
- Understanding of Docker networking
- Familiarity with YAML configuration

#### Step 1: Prepare your environment

```bash
# Create Docker network
docker network create traefik-network

# Create project directory
mkdir -p ~/weaviate-traefik/{traefik,letsencrypt}
cd ~/weaviate-traefik
```

#### Step 2: Configure DNS records

Before deploying, configure your DNS records to point to your server:

```
A Record:    weaviate.yourdomain.com    → Your-Server-IP
A Record:    grpc.yourdomain.com        → Your-Server-IP
```

DNS propagation can take 5-60 minutes. Verify with:

```bash
dig weaviate.yourdomain.com
dig grpc.yourdomain.com
```

Wait for DNS propagation before starting the services to ensure Let's Encrypt can validate your domain.

#### Step 3: Configure Traefik

1. Create `traefik/traefik.yml`:

```yaml
api:
  dashboard: true
  insecure: false

# Entry points (ports)
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":80"
    http:
      redirections:
        entryPoint:
          to: websecure
          scheme: https

  websecure:
    address: ":443"
    http:
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt

# Let's Encrypt configuration
certificatesResolvers:
  letsencrypt:
    acme:
      email: your-email@example.com
      storage: /letsencrypt/acme.json
      httpChallenge:
        entryPoint: web

# Docker provider
providers:
  docker:
    endpoint: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
    exposedByDefault: false
    network: traefik-network

log:
  level: INFO
```

#### Step 4: Create Docker Compose configuration

1. Create `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
networks:
  traefik-network:
    external: true

services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v2.10
    container_name: traefik
    restart: unless-stopped
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - ./traefik/traefik.yml:/traefik.yml:ro
      - ./letsencrypt:/letsencrypt
    networks:
      - traefik-network
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"

  weaviate:
    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:||site.weaviate_version||
    container_name: weaviate
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT: 25
      AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED: "false"
      PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH: "/var/lib/weaviate"
      DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE: "none"
      CLUSTER_HOSTNAME: "node1"
    volumes:
      - weaviate_data:/var/lib/weaviate
    networks:
      - traefik-network
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"

      # HTTP/REST API endpoint
      - "traefik.http.routers.weaviate-http.rule=Host(`weaviate.yourdomain.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.weaviate-http.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.weaviate-http.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
      - "traefik.http.routers.weaviate-http.service=weaviate-http"
      - "traefik.http.services.weaviate-http.loadbalancer.server.port=8080"

      # gRPC endpoint
      - "traefik.http.routers.weaviate-grpc.rule=Host(`grpc.yourdomain.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.weaviate-grpc.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.weaviate-grpc.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
      - "traefik.http.routers.weaviate-grpc.service=weaviate-grpc"
      - "traefik.http.services.weaviate-grpc.loadbalancer.server.port=50051"
      - "traefik.http.services.weaviate-grpc.loadbalancer.server.scheme=h2c" # Enables HTTP/2 Cleartext for gRPC

volumes:
  weaviate_data:
```

:::tip
Don't forget to replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain!
:::

#### Step 5: Set permissions and deploy

Before deploying, configure your DNS records to point to your server:

```
A Record:    weaviate.yourdomain.com    → Your-Server-IP
A Record:    grpc.yourdomain.com        → Your-Server-IP
```

The DNS propagation can take from 5-60 minutes, verify with:

```bash
dig weaviate.yourdomain.com
dig grpc.yourdomain.com
```

Wait for the DNS propagation before starting the services to ensure that Let's Encrypt can validate your domain.

```bash
# Set correct permissions for Let's Encrypt storage
touch ./letsencrypt/acme.json
chmod 600 ./letsencrypt/acme.json

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Monitor certificate acquisition
docker-compose logs -f traefik
```

Be sure to check for messages indicating successful certificate issuance.

#### Step 6: Verify your deployment

```bash
# Check running containers
docker-compose ps

# View certificates in acme.json
cat ./letsencrypt/acme.json | jq '.letsencrypt.Certificates[].domain'

# Test HTTP endpoint
curl https://weaviate.yourdomain.com/v1/meta

# Verify SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect weaviate.yourdomain.com:443 -servername weaviate.yourdomain.com < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | grep "Verify return code"
```

#### Step 7: Connect with your application

```python
import weaviate

client = weaviate.connect_to_custom(
    http_host="weaviate.yourdomain.com",
    http_port=443,
    http_secure=True,
    grpc_host="grpc.yourdomain.com",
    grpc_port=443,
    grpc_secure=True
)

try:
    print(f"✅ Connected: {client.is_ready()}")

    # Test basic operation
    collections = client.collections.list_all()
    print(f"Collections: {collections}")
finally:
    client.close()
```

### Option 3: Using Kubernetes and Cert-Manager

- **Complexity level:** Advanced
- **Perfect for:** Scalable applications, production environments, and large enterprises.
- **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes cluster required. This approach is exclusively for Kubernetes deployments and cannot be used with standalone Docker or Docker Compose setups.

What you'll need:

- Running Kubernetes cluster
- kubectl configured with cluster access
- Helm 3 installed
- Domain with ability to update DNS to LoadBalancer IP
- Strong Kubernetes knowledge

#### Step 1: Verify cluster access

```bash
# Check cluster info
kubectl cluster-info

# Verify you have proper permissions
kubectl auth can-i create namespace

# Check cluster version
kubectl version --short
```

#### Step 2: Install Cert-Manager

```bash
# Install Cert-Manager CRDs and controller
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.0/cert-manager.yaml

# Verify installation
kubectl get pods --namespace cert-manager

# Wait for all pods to be ready (may take 1-2 minutes)
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=cert-manager \
  -n cert-manager \
  --timeout=300s
```

The expected output of this:

```
✅ cert-manager-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx        1/1     Running
✅ cert-manager-cainjector-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx   1/1     Running
✅ cert-manager-webhook-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx      1/1     Running
```

#### Step 3: Install Traefik Ingress Controller

:::tip
Before proceeding with installation, configure your DNS records:

```
A Record:    weaviate.yourdomain.com    → [Pending LoadBalancer IP]
A Record:    grpc.yourdomain.com        → [Pending LoadBalancer IP]
```

You'll update these with the actual LoadBalancer IP after Step 3. DNS propagation can take 5-60 minutes, so configure these early.
:::

1. Install Traefik:

```bash
# Add Traefik Helm repository
helm repo add traefik https://traefik.github.io/charts
helm repo update

# Create namespace
kubectl create namespace traefik

# Install Traefik with HTTPS redirect enabled
helm install traefik traefik/traefik \
  --namespace traefik \
  --set ports.web.redirectTo=websecure \
  --set ports.websecure.tls.enabled=true

# Verify installation
kubectl get pods -n traefik
kubectl get svc -n traefik

# Get LoadBalancer IP (may take 1-5 minutes)
kubectl get svc -n traefik traefik -w
```

:::warning
Stop! Update your DNS records to point to the LoadBalancer IP before continuing!
:::

#### Step 4: Create Let's Encrypt ClusterIssuer

1. Create `letsencrypt-issuer.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    # Let's Encrypt production server
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

    # Email for renewal and security notices
    email: your-email@example.com

    # Secret to store ACME account private key
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod-account-key

    # HTTP-01 challenge
    solvers:
      - http01:
          ingress:
            class: traefik
```

2. Apply the issuer

```bash
kubectl apply -f letsencrypt-issuer.yaml

# Verify issuer is ready
kubectl get clusterissuer
kubectl describe clusterissuer letsencrypt-prod
```

#### Step 5: Deploy Weaviate

1. Create `weaviate-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: weaviate

    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      name: http
    - port: 50051
      targetPort: 50051
      name: grpc
  selector:
    app: weaviate
```

2. Deploy Weaviate:

```bash
kubectl apply -f weaviate-deployment.yaml

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods -n weaviate
kubectl get svc -n weaviate

# Wait for pod to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod \
  -l app=weaviate \
  -n weaviate \
  --timeout=300s

# Check logs
kubectl logs -n weaviate -l app=weaviate --tail=50
```

#### Step 6: Create Ingress with TLS

:::tip
Kubernetes standard Ingress has limited gRPC support, in production Traefik's IngressRoute CRD is recommended. It provides native gRPC support with proper HTTP/2 handling, so it's more reliable for production deployments than standard Kubernetes Ingress.
:::

1. Create `weaviate-ingressroute.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: weaviate-http-cert
  namespace: weaviate
spec:
  secretName: weaviate-http-tls
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt-prod
    kind: ClusterIssuer
  dnsNames:
    - weaviate.yourdomain.com

---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: weaviate-grpc-cert
  namespace: weaviate
spec:
  secretName: weaviate-grpc-tls
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt-prod
    kind: ClusterIssuer
  dnsNames:
    - grpc.yourdomain.com

---
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: weaviate-http
  namespace: weaviate
spec:
  entryPoints:
    - websecure
  routes:
    - match: Host(`weaviate.yourdomain.com`)
      kind: Rule
      services:
        - name: weaviate
          port: 8080
  tls:
    secretName: weaviate-http-tls

---
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: weaviate-grpc
  namespace: weaviate
spec:
  entryPoints:
    - websecure
  routes:
    - match: Host(`grpc.yourdomain.com`)
      kind: Rule
      services:
        - name: weaviate
          port: 50051
          scheme: h2c # HTTP/2 Cleartext for gRPC
  tls:
    secretName: weaviate-grpc-tls
```

2. Apply the configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f weaviate-ingressroute.yaml

# Verify IngressRoute creation
kubectl get ingressroute -n weaviate

# Watch certificate status
kubectl get certificate -n weaviate -w

# Verify certificates are issued
kubectl describe certificate weaviate-http-cert -n weaviate
kubectl describe certificate weaviate-grpc-cert -n weaviate
```

#### Step 7: Verify your SSL certificates

```bash
# Check certificate details
kubectl describe certificate weaviate-http-tls -n weaviate

# View the actual certificate
kubectl get secret weaviate-http-tls -n weaviate -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | \
  base64 -d | \
  openssl x509 -text -noout

# Check expiration date
kubectl get secret weaviate-http-tls -n weaviate -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | \
  base64 -d | \
  openssl x509 -noout -enddate
```

#### Step 8: Test your secure Weaviate

```python
import weaviate

# Connect to Kubernetes-hosted Weaviate
client = weaviate.connect_to_custom(
    http_host="weaviate.yourdomain.com",
    http_port=443,
    http_secure=True,
    grpc_host="grpc.yourdomain.com",
    grpc_port=443,
    grpc_secure=True
)

try:
    print(f"✅ Connected: {client.is_ready()}")

    # Get metadata
    meta = client.get_meta()
    print(f"Weaviate version: {meta.get('version')}")

finally:
    client.close()
```
