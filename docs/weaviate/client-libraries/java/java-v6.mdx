:::caution Preview

The `Java v6` client is available as a beta release.<br/>

This means that the library is still under development and may change in future releases, including potential breaking changes.
**We do not recommend using this client library in production environments at this time.**

This page broadly covers the Weaviate Java client (`v6` beta release). For usage information not specific to the Java client, such as code examples, see the relevant pages in the [How-to manuals & Guides](../../guides.mdx).

## Installation

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.weaviate</groupId>
    <artifactId>client6</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

<details>
  <summary>Uber JAR🫙</summary>

If you're building an uber-JAR with something like `maven-assembly-plugin`, use a shaded version with classifier `all`.
This ensures that all dynamically-loaded dependencies of `io.grpc` are resolved correctly.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.weaviate</groupId>
    <artifactId>client6</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.0</version>
    <classifier>all</classifier>
</dependency>
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Requirements:  Weaviate version compatibility & gRPC</summary>

#### Weaviate version compatibility

The `v6` Java client requires Weaviate `1.33.0` or higher. Generally, we encourage you to use the latest version of the Java client and the Weaviate Database.

#### gRPC

The `v6` client uses remote procedure calls (RPCs) under-the-hood. Accordingly, a port for gRPC must be open to your Weaviate server.

<details>
  <summary>docker-compose.yml example</summary>

If you are running Weaviate with Docker, you can map the default port (`50051`) by adding the following to your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
ports:
  - 8080:8080
  - 50051:50051
```

## Get started

import BasicPrereqs from "/_includes/prerequisites-quickstart.md";

<BasicPrereqs />

Get started with Weaviate using this Java example. The code walks you through these key steps:

1. **[Connect to Weaviate](docs/weaviate/connections/index.mdx)**: Establish a connection to a local (or Cloud) Weaviate instance.
1. **[Create a collection](../../manage-collections/index.mdx)**: Define the data schema for a `Question` collection, using an Ollama model to vectorize the data.
1. **[Import data](../../manage-objects/import.mdx)**: Fetch sample Jeopardy questions and use Weaviate's batch import for efficient ingestion and automatic vector embedding generation.
1. **[Search/query the database](../../search/index.mdx)**: Execute a vector search to find questions semantically similar to the query `biology`.
