### Community clients

There also exist [community clients](./community.md) that were prepared by our wonderful community members. These clients are not maintained by the core Weaviate team, but by the community members themselves. To contribute to these clients, contact the maintainers directly.

:::note Don't see your preferred language?
If you want to contribute a client, or to request a particular client, let us know in [the forum](https://forum.weaviate.io/)
