This page broadly covers the Weaviate Python client (`v4` release). For usage information not specific to the Python client, such as code examples, see the relevant pages in the [How-to manuals & Guides](../../guides.mdx).

## Installation

The Python client library is developed and tested using Python 3.8+. It is available on [PyPI.org](https://pypi.org/project/weaviate-client/), and can be installed with:

```bash
pip install -U weaviate-client
```

<details>
  <summary>For installing beta versions</summary>

```bash
pip install --pre -U "weaviate-client==4.*"`
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Requirements:  Weaviate version compatibility & gRPC</summary>

#### Weaviate version compatibility

The `v4` Python client requires Weaviate `1.23.7` or higher. Generally, we encourage you to use the latest version of the Python client and the Weaviate Database.

In Weaviate Cloud, the Sandboxes are compatible with the `v4` client as of 31 January, 2024. Sandboxes created before this date will not be compatible with the `v4` client.

#### gRPC

The `v4` client uses remote procedure calls (RPCs) under-the-hood. Accordingly, a port for gRPC must be open to your Weaviate server.

<details>
  <summary>docker-compose.yml example</summary>

If you are running Weaviate with Docker, you can map the default port (`50051`) by adding the following to your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
ports:
  - 8080:8080
  - 50051:50051
```

</details>

</details>

#### Weaviate Agents

You can install the Weaviate client library with the optional agents extras to use [Weaviate Agents](../../../agents/index.md). Install the client library using the following command:

```bash
pip install -U weaviate-client[agents]
```

## Get started

import BasicPrereqs from "/_includes/prerequisites-quickstart.md";

<BasicPrereqs />

Get started with Weaviate using this Python example. The code walks you through these key steps:

1. **[Connect to Weaviate](docs/weaviate/connections/index.mdx)**: Establish a connection to a local (or Cloud) Weaviate instance.
1. **[Create a collection](../../manage-collections/index.mdx)**: Define the data schema for a `Question` collection, using an Ollama model to vectorize the data.
1. **[Import data](../../manage-objects/import.mdx)**: Fetch sample Jeopardy questions and use Weaviate's batch import for efficient ingestion and automatic vector embedding generation.
1. **[Search/query the database](../../search/index.mdx)**: Execute a vector search to find questions semantically similar to the query `biology`.

import VectorsAutoSchemaError from "/_includes/error-note-vectors-autoschema.mdx";

## Asynchronous usage

The Python client library provides a synchronous API by default through the `WeaviateClient` class, which is covered on this page. An asynchronous API is also available through the `WeaviateAsyncClient` class (from `weaviate-client` `v4.7.0` and up). See the [async client API page](./async.md) for further details.

## Releases

#### Vectorizer API changes `v4.16.0`

<VectorsAutoSchemaError />

Starting with the Weaviate Python client `v4.16.0`, there are multiple changes to the vectorizer configuration API when creating collections:
- `.vectorizer_config` has been replaced with `.vector_config`
- `Configure.NamedVectors` has been replaced with `Configure.Vectors` and `Configure.MultiVectors`
- `Configure.NamedVectors.none` and `Configure.Vectorizer.none` have been replaced with  `Configure.Vectors.self_provided` and `Configure.MultiVectors.self_provided`

#### Migrating from `v3` to `v4`

If you are migrating from the Python `v3` client to the `v4` client, see this [dedicated guide](./v3_v4_migration.md).

#### Beta releases

<details>
  <summary>Migration guides - beta releases</summary>

#### Changes in `v4.4b9`

##### `weaviate.connect_to_x` methods

The `timeout` argument in now a part of the `additional_config` argument. It takes the class `weaviate.config.AdditionalConfig` as input.

##### Queries

All optional arguments to methods in the `query` namespace now are enforced as keyword arguments.

There is now runtime logic for parsing query arguments enforcing the correct type.

##### Batch processing

Introduction of three distinct algorithms using different batching styles under-the-hood:

- `client.batch.dynamic()`
- `client.batch.fixed_size()`
- `client.batch.rate_limit()`

`client.batch.dynamic() as batch` is a drop-in replacement for the previous `client.batch as batch`, which is now deprecated and will be removed on release.

```python
with client.batch.dynamic() as batch:
  ...
```

is equivalent to:

```python
with client.batch as batch:
  ...
```

`client.batch.fixed_size() as batch` is a way to configure your batching algorithm to only use a fixed size.

```python
with client.batch.dynamic() as batch:
  ...
```

is equivalent to:

```python
client.batch.configure_fixed_size()
with client.batch as batch:
  ...
```

`client.batch.rate_limit() as batch` is a new way to help avoid hitting third-party vectorization API rate limits. By specifying `request_per_minute` in the
`rate_limit()` method, you can force the batching algorithm to send objects to Weaviate at the speed your third-party API is capable of processing objects.

These methods now return completely localized context managers. This means that `failed_objects` and `failed_references` of one batch won't be included
in any subsequent calls.

Finally, if the background thread responsible for sending the batches raises an exception this is now re-raised in the main thread rather than silently erroring.

##### Filters

The argument `prop` in `Filter.by_property` has been renamed to `name`

Ref counting is now achievable using `Filter.by_ref_count(ref)` rather than `Filter([ref])`

#### Changes in `v4.4b8`

##### Reference filters

Reference filters have a simplified syntax. The new syntax looks like this:

```python
Filter.by_ref("ref").by_property("target_property")
```

#### Changes in `v4.4b7`

##### Library imports

Importing directly from `weaviate` is deprecated. Use `import weaviate.classes as wvc` instead.

##### Close client connections

Starting in v4.4b7, you have to explicitly close your client connections. There are two ways to close client connections.

Use `client.close()` to explicitly close your client connections.

```python
import weaviate
client = weaviate.connect_to_local()

print(client.is_ready())

client.close()
```

Use a context manager to close client connections for you.

```python
import weaviate

with weaviate.connect_to_local() as client:
     print(client.is_ready())

# Python closes the client when you leave the 'with' block
```

##### Batch processing

The v4.4b7 client introduces changes to `client.batch`.

- `client.batch` requires a context manager.
- Manual mode is removed, you cannot send batches with `.create_objects`.
- Batch size and the number of concurrent requests are dynamically assigned. Use `batch.configure_fixed_size` to specify values.
- The `add_reference` method is updated.
- The `to_object_collection` method is removed.

Updated `client.batch` parameters

| Old value                                  | Value in v4.4b7                          |
| :----------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| from_object_uuid: UUID                     | from_uuid: UUID                          |
| from_object_collection: str                | from_collection: str                     |
| from_property_name: str                    | from_property: str                       |
| to_object_uuid: UUID                       | to: Union[WeaviateReference, List[UUID]] |
| to_object_collection: Optional[str] = None |                                          |
| tenant: Optional[str] = None               | tenant: Optional[str] = None             |

##### Filter syntax

Filter syntax is updated in v4.4b7.

**NOTE**: The [filter reference syntax](#reference-filters) is simplified in 4.4b8.

| Old syntax                                              | New syntax in v4.4b7                                                        |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Filter(path=property)                                   | Filter.by_property(property)                                                |
| Filter(path=["ref", "target_class", "target_property"]) | Filter.by_ref().link_on("ref").by_property("target_property")               |
| FilterMetadata.ByXX                                     | Filter.by_id()<br/> Filter.by_creation_time() <br/> Filter.by_update_time() |

The pre-4.4b7 filter syntax is deprecated. The new, v4.4b7 syntax looks like this.

```python
import weaviate
import datetime
import weaviate.classes as wvc

client = weaviate.connect_to_local()

jeopardy = client.collections.use("JeopardyQuestion")
response = jeopardy.query.fetch_objects(
    filters=wvc.query.Filter.by_property("round").equal("Double Jeopardy!") &
            wvc.query.Filter.by_creation_time().greater_or_equal(datetime.datetime(2005, 1, 1)) |
            wvc.query.Filter.by_creation_time().greater_or_equal(datetime.datetime(2000, 12, 31)),
            limit=3
    )


client.close()
```

##### `reference_add_many` updated

The `reference_add_many` syntax is updated; `DataReferenceOneToMany` is now `DataReference`.

```python
collection.data.reference_add_many(
    [
        DataReference(
            from_property="ref",
            from_uuid=uuid_from,
            to_uuid=*one or a list of UUIDs*,
        )
    ]
)
```

##### References

Multi-target references updated. These are the new functions:

- `ReferenceProperty.MultiTarget`
- `DataReference.MultiTarget`
- `QueryReference.MultiTarget`

Use `ReferenceToMulti` for multi-target references.

#### Older client changes

##### References

- References are now added through a `references` parameter during collection creation, object insertion and queries.
- The `FromReference` class is now called `QueryReference`.

##### Reorganization of classes/parameters

- `weaviate.classes` submodule further split into:
  - `weaviate.classes.config`
  - `weaviate.classes.data`
  - `weaviate.classes.query`
  - `weaviate.classes.generic`
- `vector_index_config` parameter factory functions for `wvc.config.Configure` and `wvc.config.Reconfigure` have changed to, e.g.:
  ```python
  client.collections.create(
      name="MyCollection",
      # highlight-start
      vector_index_config=wvc.config.Configure.VectorIndex.hnsw(
          distance_metric=wvc.config.VectorDistances.COSINE,
          vector_cache_max_objects=1000000,
          quantizer=wvc.config.Configure.VectorIndex.Quantizer.pq()
      ),
      # highlight-end
  )
  ```
  - `vector_index_type` parameter has been removed.
- `vectorize_class_name` parameter in the `Property` constructor method is `vectorize_collection_name`.
- `[collection].data.update()` / `.replace()` \*args order changed, aiming to accommodate not providing properties when updating.
- `[collection].data.reference_add` / `.reference_delete` / `.reference_replace` the `ref` keyword was renamed to `to`.
- `collections.create()` / `get()`: `data_model` kwarg to keyword to provide generics was renamed to `data_model_properties` .
- `[object].metadata.uuid` is now `[object].uuid`.
- `[object].metadata.creation_time_unix` is now `[object].metadata.creation_time`.
- `[object].metadata.last_update_time_unix` is now `[object].metadata.last_update`.
- `quantitizer` is renamed to `quantizer`
- To request the vector in the returned data, use the `include_vector` parameter.
<!-- TODO[g-despot]: Add link to external Python references once created for "include_vector" -->

##### Data types

- Time metadata (for creation and last updated time) now returns a `datetime` object, and the parameters are renamed to `creation_time` and `last_update_time` under `MetadataQuery`.
  - `metadata.creation_time.timestamp() * 1000` will return the same value as before.
- `query.fetch_object_by_id()` now uses gRPC under the hood (rather than REST), and returns objects in the same format as other queries.
- `UUID` and `DATE` properties are returned as typed objects.
