## Instantiate a client

There are multiple ways to connect to your Weaviate instance. To instantiate a client, use one of these styles:

- [Connection helper functions](#connection-helper-functions)
- [Explicit instantiation](#explicit-instantiation)

### Connection helper functions

- `weaviate.connect_to_weaviate_cloud()`
    - Previously `connect_to_wcs()`
- `weaviate.connect_to_local()`
- `weaviate.connect_to_embedded()`
- `weaviate.connect_to_custom()`

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="wcd" label="WCD">

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# WCDInstantiation"
  endMarker="# END WCDInstantiation"
  language="py"
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="local" label="Local">

  <FilteredTextBlock
    text={PythonCode}
    startMarker="# LocalInstantiationBasic"
    endMarker="# END LocalInstantiationBasic"
    language="py"
  />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="embedded" label="Embedded">

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# EmbeddedInstantiationBasic"
  endMarker="# END EmbeddedInstantiationBasic"
  language="py"
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="custom" label="Custom">

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# CustomInstantiationBasic"
  endMarker="# END CustomInstantiationBasic"
  language="py"
/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `v4` client helper functions provide some optional parameters to customize your client.

- [Specify external API keys](#external-api-keys)
- [Specify connection timeout values](#timeout-values)
- [Specify authentication details](#authentication)

#### External API keys

To add API keys for services such as Cohere or OpenAI, use the `headers` parameter.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# LocalInstantiationWithHeaders"
  endMarker="# END LocalInstantiationWithHeaders"
  language="py"
/>

#### Timeout values

You can set timeout values, in seconds, for the client. Use the `Timeout` class to configure the timeout values for initialization checks as well as query and insert operations.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# LocalWithTimeout"
  endMarker="# END LocalWithTimeout"
  language="py"
/>

:::tip Timeouts on `generate` queries

If you see errors while using the `generate` submodule, try increasing the query timeout values (`Timeout(query=60)`). <br/><br/>The `generate` submodule uses a large language model to generate text. The submodule is dependent on the speed of the language model and any API that serves the language model. <br/><br/>Increase the timeout values to allow the client to wait longer for the language model to respond.
:::

#### Authentication

Some of the `connect` helper functions take authentication credentials. For example, `connect_to_weaviate_cloud` accepts a WCD API key or OIDC authentication credentials.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="api_key" label="API Key">

  <FilteredTextBlock
    text={PythonCode}
    startMarker="# WCDInstantiation"
    endMarker="# END WCDInstantiation"
    language="py"
  />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="oidc" label="OIDC Credentials">

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# WCDwOIDCInstantiation"
  endMarker="# END WCDwOIDCInstantiation"
  language="py"
/>

:::warning

Connecting to Weaviate Cloud (WCD) using OIDC is deprecated and will be removed in the near future. Please use API key authentication instead.

:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

For OIDC authentication with the Client Credentials flow, use the `AuthClientCredentials` class.

For OIDC authentication with the Refresh Token flow, use the `AuthBearerToken` class.

If the helper functions do not provide the customization you need, use the [`WeaviateClient`](#explicit-instantiation) class to instantiate the client.

### Explicit instantiation

If you need to pass custom parameters, use the `weaviate.WeaviateClient` class to instantiate a client. This is the most flexible way to instantiate the client object.

When you instantiate a connection directly, you have to call the `.connect()` method to connect to the server.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# DirectInstantiationFull"
  endMarker="# END DirectInstantiationFull"
  language="py"
/>

### Using Custom SSL Certificates

The Python client doesn't directly support passing SSL certificates. If you need to work with self-signed certificates (e.g. for enterprise environments), you have two options:

#### Option 1: Add the certificate to the underlying libraries

You can add the custom SSL certificates to the underlying libraries such as `certifi` that the Weaviate client library uses.

#### Option 2: Set the environment variables

Alternatively, you can set the environment variables `GRPC_DEFAULT_SSL_ROOTS_FILE_PATH` and `SSL_CERT_FILE` to the path of the certificate file. At instantiation, also set `additional_config=AdditionalConfig(trust_env=True)`. Otherwise, the client library will not use the environment variables.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# START CustomSSLExample"
  endMarker="# END CustomSSLExample"
  language="py"
/>

## Initial connection checks

When establishing a connection to the Weaviate server, the client performs a series of checks. These includes checks for the server version, and to make sure that the REST and gRPC ports are available.

You can set `skip_init_checks` to `True` to skip these checks.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# LocalInstantiationSkipChecks"
  endMarker="# END LocalInstantiationSkipChecks"
  language="py"
/>

In most cases, you should use the default `False` setting for `skip_init_checks`. However, setting `skip_init_checks=True` may be a useful temporary measure if you have connection issues.

For additional connection configuration, see [Timeout values](#timeout-values).

## `client.collections.use()` vs `client.collections.get()`

The idiomatic way to create a collection object is `client.collections.use(<COLLECTION_NAME>)`. While identical to `client.collections.get()`, `use()` is more clearly indicative of the fact that it does not perform any network requests.

We made this change as `client.collections.get()` may be misinterpreted as fetching the collection schema from the server, which it does not.

In the future, `client.collections.get()` may be deprecated.

## Batch imports

The `v4` client offers two ways to perform batch imports. From the client object directly, or from the collection object.

We recommend using the collection object to perform batch imports of single collections or tenants. If you are importing objects across many collections, such as in a multi-tenancy configuration, using `client.batch` may be more convenient.

### Batch sizing

There are three methods to configure the batching behavior. They are `dynamic`, `fixed_size` and `rate_limit`.

| Method | Description | When to use |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `dynamic` | The batch size and the number of concurrent requests are dynamically adjusted on-the-fly during import, depending on the server load. | Recommended starting point. |
| `fixed_size` | The batch size and number of concurrent requests are fixed to sizes specified by the user. | When you want to specify fixed parameters. |
| `rate_limit` | The number of objects sent to Weaviate is rate limited (specified as n_objects per minute). | When you want to avoid hitting third-party vectorization API rate limits. |

#### Usage

We recommend using a context manager as shown below.

These methods return a new context manager for each batch. Attributes that are returned from one batch, such as `failed_objects` or `failed_references`, are not included in any subsequent calls.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="dynamic" label="Dynamic">

  <FilteredTextBlock
    text={PythonCode}
    startMarker="# START BatchDynamic"
    endMarker="# END BatchDynamic"
    language="py"
  />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="fixedSize" label="Fixed Size">

  <FilteredTextBlock
    text={PythonCode}
    startMarker="# START BatchFixedSize"
    endMarker="# END BatchFixedSize"
    language="py"
  />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rateLimit" label="Rate limited">

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# START BatchRateLimit"
  endMarker="# END BatchRateLimit"
  language="py"
/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If the background thread that is responsible for sending the batches raises an exception during batch processing, the error is raised to the main thread.

### Error handling

During a batch import, any failed objects or references will be stored for retrieval. Additionally, a running count of failed objects and references is maintained.

The counter can be accessed through `batch.number_errors` within the context manager.

A list of failed objects can be obtained through `batch.failed_objects` and a list of failed references can be obtained through `batch.failed_references`.

Note that these lists are reset when a batching process is initialized. So make sure to retrieve them before starting a new batch import block.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# START BatchErrorHandling"
  endMarker="# END BatchErrorHandling"
  language="py"
/>

### Batch vectorization

:::info Added in `v1.25`.
:::

import BatchVectorizationOverview from '/_includes/code/client-libraries/batch-import.mdx';

<BatchVectorizationOverview />

The client automatically handles vectorization if you set the vectorizer when you create the collection.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Create a client">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={BatchVectorCode}
      startMarker="# START BatchVectorClient"
      endMarker="# END BatchVectorClient"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To modify the vectorization settings, update the client object. This example adds multiple vectorizers:

- **Cohere**. Set the service API key. Set the request rate.
- **OpenAI**. Set the service API key. Set the base URL.
- **VoyageAI**. Set the service API key.

 <Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Modify the client">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={BatchVectorCode}
      startMarker="# START BatchVectorizationClientModify"
      endMarker="# END BatchVectorizationClientModify"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Helper classes

The client library provides numerous additional Python classes to provide IDE assistance and typing help. You can import them individually, like so:

```
from weaviate.classes.config import Property, ConfigFactory
from weaviate.classes.data import DataObject
from weaviate.classes.query import Filter
```

But it may be convenient to import the whole set of classes like this. You will see both usage styles in our documentation.

```
import weaviate.classes as wvc
```

For discoverability, the classes are arranged into submodules.

<details>
  <summary>See the list of submodules</summary>

| Module                       | Description                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `weaviate.classes.config`    | Collection creation / modification |
| `weaviate.classes.data`      | CUD operations                     |
| `weaviate.classes.query`     | query/search operations            |
| `weaviate.classes.aggregate` | aggregate operations               |
| `weaviate.classes.generic`   | generics                           |
| `weaviate.classes.init`      | initialization                     |
| `weaviate.classes.tenants`   | tenants                            |
| `weaviate.classes.batch`     | batch operations                   |

</details>

## Connection termination

You must ensure your client connections are closed. You can use `client.close()`, or use a context manager to close client connections for you.

### `client.close()` with `try` / `finally`

This will close the client connection when the `try` block is complete (or if an exception is raised).

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# TryFinallyExample"
  endMarker="# END TryFinallyExample"
  language="py"
/>

### Context manager

This will close the client connection when you leave the `with` block.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# ClientContextManagerExample"
  endMarker="# END ClientContextManagerExample"
  language="py"
/>

## Exception handling

The client library raises exceptions for various error conditions. These include, for example:

- `weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateConnectionError` for failed connections.
- `weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateQueryError` for failed queries.
- `weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateBatchError` for failed batch operations.
- `weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateClosedClientError` for operations on a closed client.

Each of these exceptions inherit from `weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateBaseError`, and can be caught using this base class, as shown below.

<FilteredTextBlock
    text={PythonCode}
    startMarker="# START BrokenQueryExample"
    endMarker="# END BrokenQueryExample"
    language="py"
/>

You can review [this module](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-python-client/blob/main/weaviate/exceptions.py) which defines the exceptions that can be raised by the client library.

The client library doc strings also provide information on the exceptions that can be raised by each method. You can view these by using the `help` function in Python, by using the `?` operator in Jupyter notebooks, or by using an IDE, such as hover-over tooltips in VSCode.

## Thread-safety

While the Python client is fundamentally designed to be thread-safe, it's important to note that due to its dependency on the `requests` library, complete thread safety isn't guaranteed.

This is an area that we are looking to improve in the future.

:::warning Thread safety
The batching algorithm in our client is not thread-safe. Keep this in mind to help ensure smoother, more predictable operations when using our Python client in multi-threaded environments.
:::

If you are performing batching in a multi-threaded scenario, ensure that only one of the threads is performing the batching workflow at any given time. No two threads can use the same `client.batch` object at one time.

## Response object structure

Each query response object typically include multiple attributes. Consider this query.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# START ResultDisplayExample"
  endMarker="# END ResultDisplayExample"
  language="py"
/>

Each response includes attributes such as `objects` and `generated`. Then, each object in `objects` include multiple attributes such as `uuid`, `vector`, `properties`, `references`, `metadata` and `generated`.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# START ResultDisplayOutput"
  endMarker="# END ResultDisplayOutput"
  language="bash"
/>

To limit the response payload, you can specify which properties and metadata to return.

<!-- Additionally, to view the response object in a more readable format, you can use the `json.dumps()` function as shown below

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# START ResultJSONDisplayExample"
  endMarker="# END ResultJSONDisplayExample"
  language="bash"
/>

This is the formatted output.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# START ResultJSONDisplayResults"
  endMarker="# END ResultJSONDisplayResults"
  language="bash"
/> -->

## Input argument validation

The client library performs input argument validation by default to make sure that the input types match the expected types.

You can disable this validation to improve performance. You can do this by setting the `skip_argument_validation` parameter to `True` when you instantiate a collection object, with `collections.get`, or with `collections.create` for example.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# START SkipValidationExample"
  endMarker="# END SkipValidationExample"
  language="bash"
/>

This may be useful in cases where you are using the client library in a production environment, where you can be confident that the input arguments are typed correctly.

## Tab completion in Jupyter notebooks

If you use a browser to run the Python client with a Jupyter notebook, press `Tab` for code completion while you edit. If you use VSCode to run your Jupyter notebook, press `control` + `space` for code completion.

## Raw GraphQL queries

To provide raw GraphQL queries, you can use the `client.graphql_raw_query` method (previously `client.query.raw` in the `v3` client). This method takes a string as input.
