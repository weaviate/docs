Launch a Weaviate cluster from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) marketplace. AWS supports model provider integrations through SageMaker and Bedrock.

## AWS and Weaviate
Weaviate integrates with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) infrastructure and services like [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) and [Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/).

* [Deploy Weaviate from AWS Marketplace](/deploy/installation-guides/aws-marketplace.md)
* [Run embedding and generative models on SageMaker and Bedrock](/weaviate/model-providers/aws)
