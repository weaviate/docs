[Contextual AI](https://contextual.ai/) offers a [document Parser](https://docs.contextual.ai/api-reference/parse/parse-file) built for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. It enables agents to understand and navigate complex document structures. 

## Contextual AI and Weaviate
Parsed outputs can be stored in Weaviate for vector and hybrid search, metadata filtering, and RAG.
