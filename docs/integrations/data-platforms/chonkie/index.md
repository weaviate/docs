[Chonkie](https://docs.chonkie.ai/common/welcome) is a data platform that allows you to clean, chunk, embed, and query your data.

## Chonkie and Weaviate
Chonkie offers [three techniques](https://docs.chonkie.ai/oss/chefs/overview) for parsing your documents: `TableChef`, `TextChef`, and `MarkdownChef`.

Once the data is preprocessed, you can [ingest it into Weaviate](https://docs.chonkie.ai/oss/handshakes/weaviate-handshake) using the `WeaviateHandshake`.
