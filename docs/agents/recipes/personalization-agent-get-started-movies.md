In this recipe, we will use the new Weaviate `PersonalizationAgent` to fetch personalized objects from a Weaviate collection, in a user personalized way. This new agentic way of retrieving objects is based on a users persona profile and past interactions with your collection.

> 📚 You can learn more about how to use the `PersonalizationAgent`, in our ["Introducing the Weaviate Personalization Agent"](https://weaviate.io/blog/personalization-agent?utm_source=recipe&utm_campaign=agents) blog and [documentation](https://docs.weaviate.io/agents/personalization).

To help you get started, we're providing a few demo datasets, available on Hugging Face datasets 🤗:

- [Movies](https://huggingface.co/datasets/weaviate/agents/viewer/personalization-agent-movies): A dataset that lists movies, their ratings, original language etc.
- [Recipes](https://huggingface.co/datasets/weaviate/agents/viewer/personalization-agent-recipes): A dataset that lists the name, short description and cuisine of a dish.

For this example, we will be using the movies dataset to create a movie recommender service

```python
!pip install weaviate-client[agents] datasets
```

## Setting Up Weaviate & Importing Data

To use the Weaviate Personalization Agent, first, create a [Weaviate Cloud](tps://weaviate.io/deployment/serverless?utm_source=recipe&utm_campaign=agents) account👇
1. [Create Serverless Weaviate Cloud account](https://weaviate.io/deployment/serverless?utm_source=recipe&utm_campaign=agents) and setup a free [Sandbox](https://docs.weaviate.io/cloud/manage-clusters/create#sandbox-clusters?utm_source=recipe&utm_campaign=agents)
2. Go to 'Embedding' and enable it, by default, this will make it so that we use `Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0` as the embedding model
3. Take note of the `WEAVIATE_URL` and `WEAVIATE_API_KEY` to connect to your cluster below

> Info: We recommend using [Weaviate Embeddings](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/model-providers/weaviate) so you do not have to provide any extra keys for external embedding providers.

```python
import os

import weaviate
from weaviate.auth import Auth
from getpass import getpass

if "WEAVIATE_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
  os.environ["WEAVIATE_API_KEY"] = getpass("Weaviate API Key")
if "WEAVIATE_URL" not in os.environ:
  os.environ["WEAVIATE_URL"] = getpass("Weaviate URL")

client = weaviate.connect_to_weaviate_cloud(
    cluster_url=os.environ.get("WEAVIATE_URL"),
    auth_credentials=Auth.api_key(os.environ.get("WEAVIATE_API_KEY")),
)
```

### Create a New Collection

Next, we create a new collection in Weaviate called "Movies". For the agentic services in Weaviate, it's a good idea to include descriptions of the properties in your collection. These descriptions can then be used by the agent.

```python
from weaviate.classes.config import Configure, DataType, Property

# if client.collections.exists("Movies"):
    # client.collections.delete("Movies")

client.collections.create(
    "Movies",
    description="A dataset that lists movies, including their release dates, ratings, popularity etc.",
    vectorizer_config=Configure.Vectorizer.text2vec_weaviate(),
    properties=[
        Property(
            name="release_date",
            data_type=DataType.TEXT,
            description="release date of the movie",
            skip_vectorization=True,
        ),
        Property(
            name="title", data_type=DataType.TEXT, description="title of the movie"
        ),
        Property(
            name="overview",
            data_type=DataType.TEXT,
            description="overview of the movie",
        ),
        Property(
            name="genres",
            data_type=DataType.TEXT_ARRAY,
            description="genres of the movie",
        ),
        Property(
            name="vote_average",
            data_type=DataType.NUMBER,
            description="vote average of the movie",
        ),
        Property(
            name="vote_count",
            data_type=DataType.INT,
            description="vote count of the movie",
        ),
        Property(
            name="popularity",
            data_type=DataType.NUMBER,
            description="popularity of the movie",
        ),
        Property(
            name="poster_url",
            data_type=DataType.TEXT,
            description="poster path of the movie",
            skip_vectorization=True,
        ),
        Property(
            name="original_language",
            data_type=DataType.TEXT,
            description="Code of the language of the movie",
            skip_vectorization=True,
        ),
    ],
)
```

Python output:
```text
<weaviate.collections.collection.sync.Collection at 0x7f62f442b250>
```
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("weaviate/agents", "personalization-agent-movies", split="train", streaming=True)

movies_collection = client.collections.get("Movies")

with movies_collection.batch.dynamic() as batch:
    for item in dataset:
        batch.add_object(properties=item["properties"])
```

## Create a Personalization Agent

Below, we create a `PersonalizationAgent` for the `"Movies"` collection. If an agent for this collection already exists, we can simply connect to it.

When creating a new `PeresonalizationAgent`, we can also optioanlly define `user_properties`.

User properties can be anything that may be useful iformation about users that will be added to the agent. In this case, since we are creating a Movie recommender service, we may ask each persona to be added with ther `age`, `favorite_genres` and `languages`.

```python
from weaviate.agents.personalization import PersonalizationAgent

if PersonalizationAgent.exists(client, "Movies"):
  agent = PersonalizationAgent.connect(
          client=client,
          reference_collection="Movies",
      )
else:
  agent = PersonalizationAgent.create(
          client=client,
          reference_collection="Movies",
          user_properties={
            "age": DataType.NUMBER,
            "favorite_genres": DataType.TEXT_ARRAY,
            "languages": DataType.TEXT_ARRAY,
        },
      )

```

### Adding New Personas

We can add new users with `add_persona`, listing the requested user properties when adding them. Try changing the code block below to represent yourself if you like 👇

```python
from uuid import uuid4
from weaviate.agents.classes import Persona, PersonaInteraction

persona_id = uuid4()
agent.add_persona(
    Persona(
        persona_id=persona_id,
        properties={
              "age": 29,
              "favorite_genres": ["RomCom", "Adventure", "Sci-Fi", "Fantasy"],
              "languages": ["English", "French"],
          },
    )
)
```

### Adding Interactions

Once we have at least one persona for our agent, we can start adding interactions for that persona. For example, in this movie recommender service, it makes sense to add a personas movie reviews.

Each interaction can have a weight between -1.0 (negative) and 1.0 positive. So, we can add some reviews for a number or films below.

It's a good idea to think about what kind of end application may be forwarding these interactions and have a rule around what each weight might represent. For example:
- 1.0: favorite movie  
- 0.8: user liked the movie
- 0.5: user viewed and did not review the movie
- -0.5: user disliked the movie
- -1.0: user absolutely hated the movie 👎

```python
from uuid import UUID
from weaviate.collections.classes.filters import Filter

reviewed_movies = [
    "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them",
    "The Emoji Movie",
    "Titanic",
    "The Shining",
    "Jumanji",
    "West Side Story",
    "The Shape of Water",
    "Morbius"
]

reviews_dict = {
    movie.properties["title"]: movie
    for movie in movies_collection.query.fetch_objects(
        filters=Filter.by_property("title").contains_any(reviewed_movies), limit=20
    ).objects
}

interactions = [
    PersonaInteraction(
        persona_id=persona_id, item_id=reviews_dict["Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"].uuid, weight=0.8
    ),
    PersonaInteraction(
        persona_id=persona_id, item_id=reviews_dict["The Emoji Movie"].uuid, weight=-0.5
    ),
    PersonaInteraction(
        persona_id=persona_id, item_id=reviews_dict["Titanic"].uuid, weight=0.5
    ),
    PersonaInteraction(
        persona_id=persona_id, item_id=reviews_dict["The Shining"].uuid, weight=0.5
    ),
    PersonaInteraction(
        persona_id=persona_id, item_id=reviews_dict["Jumanji"].uuid, weight=0.8
    ),
    PersonaInteraction(
        persona_id=persona_id, item_id=reviews_dict["West Side Story"].uuid, weight=-0.5
    ),
    PersonaInteraction(
        persona_id=persona_id, item_id=reviews_dict["The Shape of Water"].uuid, weight=-1.0
    ),
    PersonaInteraction(
        persona_id=persona_id, item_id=reviews_dict["Morbius"].uuid, weight=-1.0
    ),
]
```

```python
agent.add_interactions(interactions=interactions)
```

## Get Recommendations and Rationale

Now that we have a persona and some interactions for that persona, we can start getting recommended objects from the agent with `get_objects`. We have two options here: we can set `use_agent_ranking` or not.

When we do not use agent ranking, the returned objects are ranked by classic ML clustering, whereas when we do use it, it will go through an additional re-ranking with an LLM and an optioanl `instruction`.

When we use agent ranking, we can also see the rationale behind the ranking in `ranking_rationale` as we've done below 👇

```python
response = agent.get_objects(persona_id, limit=25, use_agent_ranking=True)

print(response.ranking_rationale)
for i, obj in enumerate(response.objects):
    print(f"*****{i}*****")
    print(obj.properties["title"])
    print(obj.properties["overview"])
    print(obj.properties["genres"])
    print(f"vote_average: {obj.properties['vote_average']}")
    print(obj.properties['poster_url'])
```

Python output:

Optionally, you can also provide the agent with an instruction too. This allows the agent LLM to have more context as to what kind of recommendations it could make.

It may also make sense to set a higher limit for the initial ranking, and then filter down to a smaller group after the agent ranking as we've done below 👇

```python
response = agent.get_objects(persona_id,
                             limit=100,
                             use_agent_ranking=True,
                             instruction="""Your task is to recommend a diverse set of movies that the user may
                             like based on their fave genres and past interactions. Try to avoid recommending multiple films from within
                             the same cinematic universe.""",
)

print(response.ranking_rationale)
for i, obj in enumerate(response.objects[:20]):
    print(f"*****{i}*****")
    print(obj.properties["title"])
    print(obj.properties["overview"])
    print(obj.properties["genres"])
    print(f"vote_average: {obj.properties['vote_average']}")
    print(obj.properties['poster_url'])
```

Python output:
```text
We've highlighted a mix of movies from the user's favorite genres — RomCom, Adventure, Sci-Fi, and Fantasy — ensuring a diverse selection. We've also included some lesser-known gems to provide variety while avoiding multiple entries from the same cinematic universe.
