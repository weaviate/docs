In this recipe, we will use the new Weaviate `PersonalizationAgent` to fetch personalized objects from a Weaviate collection, in a user personalized way. This new agentic way of retrieving objects is based on a users persona profile and past interactions with your collection.

> ðŸ“š You can learn more about how to use the `PersonalizationAgent`, in our ["Introducing the Weaviate Personalization Agent"](https://weaviate.io/blog/personalization-agent?utm_source=recipe&utm_campaign=agents) blog and [documentation](https://docs.weaviate.io/agents/personalization).

To help you get started, we're providing a few demo datasets, available on Hugging Face datasets ðŸ¤—:
- [Recipes](https://huggingface.co/datasets/weaviate/agents/viewer/personalization-agent-recipes): A dataset that lists the name, short description and cuisine of a dish.
- [Movies](https://huggingface.co/datasets/weaviate/agents/viewer/personalization-agent-movies): A dataset that lists movies, their ratings, original language etc.

For this example, we will be using the recipes dataset to create a food recommender service

```python
!pip install 'weaviate-client[agents]' datasets
```

## Setting Up Weaviate & Importing Data

To use the Weaviate Personalization Agent, first, create a [Weaviate Cloud](tps://weaviate.io/deployment/serverless?utm_source=recipe&utm_campaign=agents) accountðŸ‘‡
1. [Create Serverless Weaviate Cloud account](https://weaviate.io/deployment/serverless?utm_source=recipe&utm_campaign=agents) and setup a free [Sandbox](https://docs.weaviate.io/cloud/manage-clusters/create#sandbox-clusters?utm_source=recipe&utm_campaign=agents)
2. Go to 'Embedding' and enable it, by default, this will make it so that we use `Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0` as the embedding model
3. Take note of the `WEAVIATE_URL` and `WEAVIATE_API_KEY` to connect to your cluster below

> Info: We recommend using [Weaviate Embeddings](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/model-providers/weaviate) so you do not have to provide any extra keys for external embedding providers.

```python
import os

import weaviate
from weaviate.auth import Auth
from getpass import getpass

if "WEAVIATE_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
  os.environ["WEAVIATE_API_KEY"] = getpass("Weaviate API Key")
if "WEAVIATE_URL" not in os.environ:
  os.environ["WEAVIATE_URL"] = getpass("Weaviate URL")

client = weaviate.connect_to_weaviate_cloud(
    cluster_url=os.environ.get("WEAVIATE_URL"),
    auth_credentials=Auth.api_key(os.environ.get("WEAVIATE_API_KEY")),
)
```

### Create a New Collection

Next, we create a new collection in Weaviate called "Recipes". For the agentic services in Weaviate, it's a good idea to include descriptions of the properties in your collection. These descriptions can then be used by the agent.

```python
from weaviate.classes.config import Configure, DataType, Property

# if client.collections.exists("Recipes"):
#     client.collections.delete("Recipes")

client.collections.create(
    "Recipes",
    description="A dataset that lists recipes with titles, desctiptions, and labels indicating cuisine",
    vectorizer_config=Configure.Vectorizer.text2vec_weaviate(),
    properties=[
        Property(
            name="title", data_type=DataType.TEXT, description="title of the recipe"
        ),
        Property(
            name="labels",
            data_type=DataType.TEXT,
            description="the cuisine the recipe belongs to",
        ),
        Property(
            name="description",
            data_type=DataType.TEXT,
            description="short description of the recipe",
        ),
    ],
)
```

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("weaviate/agents", "personalization-agent-recipes", split="train", streaming=True)

recipes_collection = client.collections.get("Recipes")

with recipes_collection.batch.dynamic() as batch:
    for item in dataset:
        batch.add_object(properties=item["properties"])

```

## Create a Personalization Agent

Below, we create a `PersonalizationAgent` for the `"Recipes"` collection. If an agent for this collection already exists, we can simply connect to it.

When creating a new `PeresonalizationAgent`, we can also optioanlly define `user_properties`.

User properties can be anything that may be useful iformation about users that will be added to the agent. In this case, since we are creating a food recommender service, we may ask each persona to be added with ther `favorite_cuisines`, `likes` and `dislikes`.

```python
from weaviate.agents.personalization import PersonalizationAgent

if PersonalizationAgent.exists(client, "Recipes"):
  agent = PersonalizationAgent.connect(
          client=client,
          reference_collection="Recipes",
      )
else:
  agent = PersonalizationAgent.create(
          client=client,
          reference_collection="Recipes",
          user_properties={
              "favorite_cuisines": DataType.TEXT_ARRAY,
              "likes": DataType.TEXT_ARRAY,
              "dislikes": DataType.TEXT_ARRAY
          },
      )

```

### Adding New Personas

We can add new users with `add_persona`, listing the requested user properties when adding them. Try changing the code block below to represent yourself if you like ðŸ‘‡

```python
from uuid import uuid4
from weaviate.agents.classes import Persona, PersonaInteraction

persona_id = uuid4()
agent.add_persona(
    Persona(
        persona_id=persona_id,
        properties={
            "favorite_cuisines": ["Italian", "Thai"],
            "likes": ["chocolate", "salmon", "pasta", "most veggies"],
            "dislikes": ["okra", "mushroom"],
        },
    )
)
```

```python
agent.get_persona(persona_id)

```

Python output:
```text
Persona(persona_id=UUID('df987437-4d10-44d6-b613-dfff31f715fb'), properties={'favorite_cuisines': ['Italian', 'Thai'], 'dislikes': ['okra', 'mushroom'], 'allergies': None, 'likes': ['chocolate', 'salmon', 'pasta', 'most veggies']})
```
### Adding Interactions

Once we have at least one persona for our agent, we can start adding interactions for that persona. For example, in this food recommender service, it makes sense to add a personas food reviews.

Each interaction can have a weight between -1.0 (negative) and 1.0 positive. So, we can add some reviews for a number or dishes below.

It's a good idea to think about what kind of end application may be forwarding these interactions and have a rule around what each weight might represent. For example, let's imagine a recipes website
- 1.0: favorite meal  
- 0.8: user liked the dish
- 0.5: user viewed the recipe page
- -0.5: user disliked the dish
- -1.0: user absolutely hated the dish ðŸ‘Ž

```python
from uuid import UUID
from weaviate.collections.classes.filters import Filter

reviewed_foods = [
    "Coq au Vin",
    "Chicken Tikka Masala",
    "Gnocchi alla Sorrentina",
    "Matcha Ice Cream",
    "Fiorentina Steak",
    "Nabe",
    "Duck Confit",
    "Pappardelle with Porcini"
]

reviews_dict = {
    recipe.properties["title"]: recipe
    for recipe in recipes_collection.query.fetch_objects(
        filters=Filter.by_property("title").contains_any(reviewed_foods), limit=20
    ).objects
}

interactions = [
    PersonaInteraction(
        persona_id=persona_id, item_id=reviews_dict["Coq au Vin"].uuid, weight=0.8
    ),
    PersonaInteraction(
        persona_id=persona_id, item_id=reviews_dict["Chicken Tikka Masala"].uuid, weight=0.8
    ),
    PersonaInteraction(
        persona_id=persona_id, item_id=reviews_dict["Matcha Ice Cream"].uuid, weight=0.8
    ),
    PersonaInteraction(
        persona_id=persona_id, item_id=reviews_dict["Gnocchi alla Sorrentina"].uuid, weight=0.5
    ),
    PersonaInteraction(
        persona_id=persona_id, item_id=reviews_dict["Fiorentina Steak"].uuid, weight=0.8
    ),
    PersonaInteraction(
        persona_id=persona_id, item_id=reviews_dict["Nabe"].uuid, weight=0.5
    ),
    PersonaInteraction(
        persona_id=persona_id, item_id=reviews_dict["Duck Confit"].uuid, weight=1.0
    ),
    PersonaInteraction(
        persona_id=persona_id, item_id=reviews_dict["Pappardelle with Porcini"].uuid, weight=-1.0
    ),

]
```

```python
agent.add_interactions(interactions=interactions)
```

## Get Recommendations and Rationale

Now that we have a persona and some interactions for that persona, we can start getting recommended objects from the agent with `get_objects`. We have two options here: we can set `use_agent_ranking` or not.

When we do not use agent ranking, the returned objects are ranked by classic ML clustering, whereas when we do use it, it will go through an additional re-ranking with an LLM and an optioanl `instruction`.

When we use agent ranking, we can also see the rationale behind the ranking in `ranking_rationale` as we've done below ðŸ‘‡

```python
response = agent.get_objects(persona_id, limit=25, use_agent_ranking=True)

print(response.ranking_rationale)
for i, obj in enumerate(response.objects):
    print(f"*****{i}*****")
    print(obj.properties["title"])
    print(obj.properties["description"])
    print(obj.properties["labels"])
```

Python output:

### Get Recommendations with an Instruction

Optionally, you can also provide the agent with an instruction too. This allows the agent LLM to have more context as to what kind of recommendations it could make.

It may also make sense to set a higher limit for the initial ranking, and then filter down to a smaller group after the agent ranking as we've done below ðŸ‘‡

```python
response = agent.get_objects(persona_id,
                             limit=50,
                             use_agent_ranking=True,
                             instruction="""Your task is to recommend a diverse set of dishes to the user
                             taking into account their likes and dislikes. It's especially important to avoid their dislikes.""",
)

print(response.ranking_rationale)
for i, obj in enumerate(response.objects[:10]):
    print(f"*****{i}*****")
    print(obj.properties["title"])
    print(obj.properties["description"])
    print(obj.properties["labels"])
```

Python output:
