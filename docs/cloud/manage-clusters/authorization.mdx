:::info

This guide only applies to clusters that have [RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)](/weaviate/configuration/rbac/index.mdx) enabled. New clusters with Weaviate version `v1.30` (or later) have RBAC enabled by default.

:::

## Create a role

Custom roles allow you to define specific permissions for different users or applications accessing your Weaviate cluster. You can control access to collections, tenants, and specific operations.

## Edit a role

You can modify the permissions and settings of existing custom roles at any time.

<div

    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(54.10879629629629% + 50px)",

<details>
    <summary>Steps to edit a role</summary>

To edit a role, follow these steps:

1. From the roles management page, locate the role you want to edit.
2. Click the `Pencil` button next to the role you want to modify.
3. In the role editing interface, you can:
    * Update collection permissions by checking or unchecking the appropriate boxes for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations
    * Add or remove additional constraints from the role's scope using the dropdown menus (e.g. which collections the permissions apply to)
4. After making your changes, click the `Update` button to save the modifications.
5. Changes to role permissions take effect immediately for all API keys assigned to that role.

</details>

## Delete a role

When you no longer need a custom role, you can delete it. This action will affect all API keys currently assigned to this role.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(54.10879629629629% + 50px)",
    height: 0,
  }}
>
  <iframe
    id="np1y8gycep"
    src="https://app.guideflow.com/embed/np1y8gycep"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    style={{ overflow: "hidden", position: "absolute", border: "none" }}
    scrolling="no"
    allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"
    webKitAllowFullScreen
    mozAllowFullScreen
    allowFullScreen
    allowTransparency="true"
  />
  <script
    src="https://app.guideflow.com/assets/opt.js"
    data-iframe-id="np1y8gycep"
  ></script>
</div>

<br />

<details>
    <summary>Steps to delete a role</summary>

To delete a role, follow these steps:

1. From the roles management page, locate the role you want to delete.
2. Click the `Trash can` button next to the role you want to remove.
3. In the confirmation dialog, type the exact role name to confirm the deletion. This prevents accidental deletions.
4. Click `Confirm and delete` to permanently remove the role.

</details>

Deleting a role is permanent and cannot be undone. This action will:

- Remove the role and all its associated permissions
- Affect any API keys that were assigned to this role
- Potentially break applications that rely on the permissions granted by this role

Make sure to update or reassign any affected API keys before deleting a role.

:::info
You cannot delete the built-in admin and viewer roles, as these are system-defined roles required for basic cluster operations.
