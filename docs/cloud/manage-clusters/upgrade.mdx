[Weaviate Cloud (WCD)](/go/console?utm_content=cloud) does not automatically update existing clusters when a new version of Weaviate core is released.

If you have a stand-alone cluster, an update requires system downtime. Consider your business needs, and update your cluster when you have a suitable maintenance window. There is no downtime if you have high availability (HA) enabled on your cluster.

## Update the Weaviate Database version

When a Weaviate Database version update is available, a notification banner appears at the top of your cluster details page. The banner color and urgency depend on the update deadline:

- **Info (Green background)**: Standard update notification
- **Warning (Yellow/Orange background)**: Update deadline approaching
- **Critical (Red background)**: Update deadline is imminent

    <summary>Steps to update a cluster</summary>

To update a cluster, follow these steps:

1.  Open the [Weaviate Cloud console](/go/console?utm_content=cloud) and [select your cluster](../manage-clusters/status.mdx).
2.  If an update is available, you'll see a notification banner at the top of the cluster details page. Click the `Update` button in the banner.
3.  Select a Weaviate version for the update.
4.  Enter the cluster name to confirm the update.
5.  Click the `Confirm and update` button to start the update process.

## Update process and status

During the update, the `Update` button becomes disabled and displays a loading indicator with descriptive text based on the current status:

- **Preparing**: The cluster is being prepared for update (may be unhealthy, being created, restarted, or expanding disk)
- **Updating**: The cluster is undergoing update operations or the version is being updated
- **Backup in Progress**: A data backup is currently in progress

The console displays status indicators throughout the process. The indicators disappear and Weaviate Cloud sends a confirmation email when the cluster is ready.

:::info Important notes about the update process

- A complete backup of your data will be created before the Weaviate database version is updated
- The total duration of this process depends on the amount of data in your cluster
- For clusters with large volumes of data, the total duration to update may be lengthy
- Status indicators may not appear in a specific order, as they reflect real-time provisioning status
