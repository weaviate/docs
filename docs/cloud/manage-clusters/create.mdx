[Weaviate Cloud (WCD)](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) provides two instance types.

- **[Sandbox clusters](#sandbox-clusters)**: Sandbox clusters are small, free clusters designed for learning and experimentation. Sandbox clusters are not scalable and expire after 14 days. You will also have an option to extend their lifetime and convert them into a production ready Serverless cluster.
- **[Serverless clusters](#serverless-clusters)**: Serverless clusters are robust, paid clusters designed for production use.

When you log into the Weaviate Cloud web console, the `Clusters` panel lists your clusters. There are no clusters when you log in to a new account.

    <summary>Steps to create a Sandbox cluster</summary>

To create a Sandbox cluster, follow these steps:

1. In the clusters sidebar, click the plus button.
2. Select the `Sandbox` option.
3. Choose a name for your cluster.
4. Select a cloud region from the dropdown.
5. Configure the `Advanced configuration` settings if needed.
6. Click the `Create cluster` button.

#### Advanced configuration for Serverless clusters

The following advanced configuration settings are available:

- [`Enable auto schema generation`](/weaviate/config-refs/collections#auto-schema)
- [`Enable async indexing`](/weaviate/concepts/vector-index#asynchronous-indexing)
- [`Enable async replication`](/deploy/configuration/replication#async-replication-settings)
- `Allow all CORS origins`

</details>

## Serverless clusters

Serverless clusters require billing details. Weaviate Cloud prompts you to add billing details if you have not already added them.

    <summary>Steps to create a Serverless cluster</summary>

To create a Serverless cluster, follow these steps:

1. In the clusters sidebar, click the plus button.
2. Select the `Serverless` option.
3. Choose a name for your cluster.
4. Select a cloud region from the dropdown.
5.  Optionally, enable `High Availability` to reduce downtime during upgrades or scaling.
6. Configure the `Advanced configuration` settings if needed.
7. Click the `Create cluster` button.

#### Advanced configuration for Serverless clusters

The following advanced configuration settings are available:

  * [`Enable auto schema generation`](/weaviate/config-refs/collections#auto-schema)
  * [`Enable async indexing`](/weaviate/concepts/vector-index#asynchronous-indexing)
  * [`Enable async replication`](/deploy/configuration/replication#async-replication-settings)
  * `Allow all CORS origins`

## Authentication

Weaviate Cloud clusters use API key authentication. The authentication approach depends on whether [RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)](/weaviate/configuration/rbac) is enabled:

#### Authentication with RBAC enabled

New clusters with Weaviate version `v1.30` (or later) have RBAC enabled by default. With RBAC enabled, you create API keys with specific roles for granular access control.

When you develop your client application, use an API key to connect your client to the cluster. For detailed instructions on finding and managing your API keys, including creating new keys and managing roles, check out this guide:

- **[Manage clusters: Authentication](/cloud/manage-clusters/authentication.mdx)**

#### Authentication with RBAC disabled (deprecated)

If RBAC is not enabled (before `v1.30`), clusters use the traditional approach with two default API keys:

- **Admin keys**: Provide read-write access to the database
- **ReadOnly keys**: Provide read-only access to the database

Serverless clusters can create, delete, edit, and rotate API keys, while Sandbox clusters cannot modify the default keys.

## Weaviate Database version

When you provision a new cluster, Weaviate Cloud uses the latest version of Weaviate to set up the new cluster. There may be a short delay between the release of a new Weaviate version and its availability in Weaviate Cloud.

Weaviate Cloud does not automatically update existing clusters when a new version of Weaviate is released.

For more details on Weaviate Cloud versioning, see:

- **[Account management: Server version](/cloud/platform/version)**.

## Number of clusters

<!-- TODO[g-despot]: Check if this is true.-->

By default, an organization can have up to six (6) serverless clusters and two (2) sandbox clusters at the same time. To change these limits, [contact support](mailto:support@weaviate.io).
