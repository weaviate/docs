[Weaviate Cloud (WCD)](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) offers multiple options on how to connect to your cluster:

- **[Connect with APIs](#connect-with-an-api)**:

  - Use [client libraries](/docs/weaviate/client-libraries) to connect to a Weaviate Cloud instance.
  - Use a tool, such as cURL, to connect to the [REST API](/docs/weaviate/api/rest).

- **[Connect through the Weaviate Cloud console](#connect-to-the-weaviate-cloud-console)**:

  - Login to manage your clusters, users, and billing.
  - Use built-in tools to work with your data.

## Connect with an API

The Weaviate client libraries use API keys to authenticate to Weaviate Cloud instances. By default, API keys are enabled for all clusters.
Both **Serverless** and **Sandbox** clusters have two types of keys:

- `Admin key`: An administrator that enables read-write access to the cluster.
- `ReadOnly key`: A viewer key that only allows read access to the cluster.

The Weaviate server authenticates every request.

- If you use a Weaviate client library, pass the API key when you instantiate the client connection. After the connection is established, you do not have to pass the API key when you make additional requests.
- If you use a tool like cURL, add your API key to the request header.

For authentication details, see [Account management: Authentication](/docs/cloud/platform/manage-api-keys).

### Retrieve your API key and REST endpoint {#retrieve-your-api-keys}

import RetrieveAPIKeys from '/_includes/wcs/retrieve-api-keys.mdx';

<RetrieveAPIKeys />

### Environment variables

Do not hard-code your API key and Weaviate URL in your client code. Consider passing them as environment variables or using a similar secure coding technique.

```bash
export WEAVIATE_URL="replaceThisWithYourRESTEndpointURL"
export WEAVIATE_API_KEY="replaceThisWithYourAPIKey"
```

### Connection example

To connect, use the `REST Endpoint` URL and the `Admin` API key:

import ConnectIsReady from '/_includes/code/quickstart/quickstart.is_ready.mdx';

<ConnectIsReady />

## Connect to the Weaviate Cloud console

The Weaviate Cloud console uses your email address and password for authentication. You create the password when you create your Weaviate Cloud account.

To connect to the console, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Weaviate Cloud login page](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) in a browser.
1. Enter your email address and password to authenticate.
1. Click `Login`.

## Connect an instance with the Query Tool

The built-in [Query tool](/docs/cloud/tools/query-tool) connects directly to clusters in your Weaviate Cloud organization without any additional authentication.

import APIKeyInHeader from "/docs/cloud/img/wcs-auth-header.jpg";

export const imageContent = (
  <p>
    To connect the Query tool to a Weaviate instance that is not part of your
    Weaviate Cloud organization, provide an API key for the remote instance.{" "}
    <br />
    <br />
    Add the API key to the connection <code>Headers</code> at the bottom of the
    Query tool tab.
  </p>
);

## Troubleshooting

This section has solutions for some common problems. For additional help, [contact support](#support--feedback).

### Reset your password

To reset your Weaviate Cloud password, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Weaviate Cloud [login page](https://console.weaviate.cloud).
1. Click on click the login button.
1. Click `Forgot Password`.
1. Check your email account for a password reset email from Weaviate Cloud.
1. Click the link and follow the instructions to reset your password. The link is only valid for five minutes.

### Connection timeouts

The new Python client uses the gRPC protocol to connect to Weaviate Cloud. The gRPC protocol improves query performance, but the protocol is sensitive to network speeds. If you run into timeout errors, increase the connection timeout value in your connection code.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import FilteredTextBlock from "@site/src/components/Documentation/FilteredTextBlock";
import PyCodeSupp from "!!raw-loader!/_includes/code/client-libraries/python_slow_connection.py";

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python Client v4">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCodeSupp}
      startMarker="# START ConnectWithLongTimeOut"
      endMarker="# END ConnectWithLongTimeOut"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Alternatively, leave the default timeout values, but skip the initial connection checks.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python Client v4">
    <FilteredTextBlock
      text={PyCodeSupp}
      startMarker="# START ConnectWithSkipChecks"
      endMarker="# END ConnectWithSkipChecks"
      language="py"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### gRPC health check error

**Problem**: gRPC returns a health check error after you update a Serverless cluster.

```
weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateGRPCUnavailableError: gRPC health check could not be completed.
```

**Solution**: Verify the cluster URL is correct and update the URL if needed.

When a Serverless cluster is updated, the cluster URL may change slightly. Weaviate Cloud still routes the old URL, so some connections work, however the new gRPC and the old HTTP URLS are different so connections that require gRCP fail.

To check the URLs, open the Weaviate Cloud Console and check the details panel for your cluster. If you prefix Cluster URL with `grpc-`, the Cluster URL and the Cluster gRPC URL should match.

import EndpointURLs from "/docs/cloud/img/weaviate-cloud-endpoint-urls.png";

export const imageContent2 = (
  <p>
    Compare the Cluster URL with the connection URL in your application. The old
    URL and the new URL are similar, but the new one may have an extra subdomain
    such as <code>.c0.region</code>.
    <br />
    <br />
    If the URLs are different, update your application's connection code to use the
    new Cluster URL.
  </p>
);
