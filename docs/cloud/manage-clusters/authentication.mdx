[Weaviate Cloud (WCD)](/go/console?utm_content=cloud) uses [RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)](/weaviate/configuration/rbac/index.mdx) to manage authentication. Below, you can find guides on how to create, edit, rotate and delete API keys for accessing Weaviate Cloud.

### Create an API key

If you don't have an existing API key, you'll need to create one. Follow these steps to find the API keys section and create a new key if necessary:

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(54.10879629629629% + 50px)",
    height: 0,
  }}
>
  <iframe
    id="dkd8z43f9r"
    src="https://app.guideflow.com/embed/dkd8z43f9r"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    style={{ overflow: "hidden", position: "absolute", border: "none" }}
    scrolling="no"
    allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"
    webKitAllowFullScreen
    mozAllowFullScreen
    allowFullScreen
    allowTransparency="true"
  />
  <script
    src="https://app.guideflow.com/assets/opt.js"
    data-iframe-id="dkd8z43f9r"
  ></script>
</div>

<br />

    <summary>Steps to create a new API key</summary>

To create an API key, follow these steps:

1.  Open the [Weaviate Cloud console](/go/console?utm_content=cloud) and [select your cluster](/cloud/manage-clusters/status#select-a-cluster).
2.  Navigate to the `API Keys` section, found in the `Cluster details` panel.
3.  If you need a new API key, click the `New key` button.
4.  In the `Create API Key` form, provide a descriptive name for your key.
5.  Choose the role for this API key. You can either select an existing role like `admin` or `viewer`, or [create a new role](/cloud/manage-clusters/authorization) with specific permissions.
6.  Click the `Create key` button.
7.  **Important:** This is the only time your API key will be displayed. Make sure to copy it or download it and store it in a secure location immediately after creation. You will not be able to retrieve the full key again.

### Rotate an API key

Rotating an API key allows you to generate a new key while invalidating the old one, enhancing security.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(54.10879629629629% + 50px)",
