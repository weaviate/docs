This page describes the default configuration settings applied to Weaviate Cloud clusters. These settings control various aspects of your cluster's behavior, including database limits, authentication, backups, and usage metrics.

The majority of these settings are configured via environment variables. For more details on each environment variable, refer to the [environment variable pages](/deploy/configuration/env-vars) in the [Deployment section](/deploy) of our documentation.

## Weaviate Database settings

These settings control core database functionality and limits.

| Setting | Requires restart | Default value | User configurable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`MAXIMUM_ALLOWED_COLLECTIONS_COUNT`](/deploy/configuration/env-vars/index.md#MAXIMUM_ALLOWED_COLLECTIONS_COUNT) | No | 1000 | No |
| [`AUTOSCHEMA_ENABLED`](/deploy/configuration/env-vars/index.md#AUTOSCHEMA_ENABLED) | No | true | Yes |
| [`ASYNC_REPLICATION_DISABLED`](/deploy/configuration/env-vars/index.md#ASYNC_REPLICATION_DISABLED) | No | false | No |
| [`ASYNC_INDEXING`](/deploy/configuration/env-vars/index.md#ASYNC_INDEXING) | Yes | true | No |
| [`DEFAULT_QUANTIZATION`](/deploy/configuration/env-vars/index.md#DEFAULT_QUANTIZATION) | No | [RQ-8](/weaviate/configuration/compression/rq-compression.md) | No |
| `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` | Yes | https://console.weaviate.cloud | Yes (to allow any) |

## User management & permissions

These settings control authentication and authorization for your cluster. These settings are not user configurable.

| Setting | Default value |
| --- | --- |
| [`AUTHORIZATION_RBAC_ENABLED`](/deploy/configuration/env-vars/index.md#AUTHORIZATION_RBAC_ENABLED) | true |
| [`AUTHENTICATION_DB_USERS_ENABLED`](/deploy/configuration/env-vars/index.md#AUTHENTICATION_DB_USERS_ENABLED) | true |
| [`AUTHENTICATION_OIDC_ENABLED`](/deploy/configuration/env-vars/index.md#AUTHENTICATION_OIDC_ENABLED) | true |

For more information on authentication and authorization, see:
- [Authentication](/cloud/manage-clusters/authentication)
- [Authorization](/cloud/manage-clusters/authorization)

## Backups

Each Weaviate Cloud instance is automatically backed up daily by default. Additional backups can be triggered manually via the API.

Backups are retained per the applicable backup retention period of that cluster, such as 7 days for Flex Shared Cloud clusters.

To restore a backup, [contact Weaviate Cloud support](https://console.weaviate.cloud/support).

## Query settings

These settings control default query behavior.

| Setting | Default value |
| --- | --- |
| [`QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT`](/deploy/configuration/env-vars/index.md#QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT) | 10 |
| [`QUERY_MAXIMUM_RESULTS`](/deploy/configuration/env-vars/index.md#QUERY_MAXIMUM_RESULTS) | 100000 |

## Modules

Weaviate Cloud clusters do not have a default vectorizer module configured. As a result, you must specify a vectorizer integration when creating collections, or import your own vectors.

To view the list of enabled modules on your cluster, see [Cluster Status: Enabled Modules](/cloud/manage-clusters/status#enabled-modules).
