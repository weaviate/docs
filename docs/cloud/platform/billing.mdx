Sandbox clusters are free. You do not need a billing account to create a Sandbox cluster.

Shared Cloud clusters are charged for resource usage. The monthly charge is determined by your usage and your support plan. You have to have a billing account to create a Shared Cloud cluster.

To estimate costs for different usage plans, see the [pricing page](https://weaviate.io/pricing).

:::note

If you have signed up for Weaviate Cloud through an external cloud provider like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ng2dfhb4yjoic) or [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/weaviate-gcp-mktplace/weaviate?inv=1&invt=AbwjlA), the billing will be managed through that cloud provider's marketplace.

## Create an account

Weaviate Cloud (WCD) uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for billing. To create a Stripe account, follow these steps:

import EditOrganization from '/_includes/wcs/weaviate-cloud-edit-organization.mdx'

<EditOrganization/>

import BillingSection from '/docs/cloud/img/weaviate-cloud-billing-section.png';

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    Under the <code>Billing</code> section, click on the{' '}
    <code>Add payment method</code> button (<span class="callout">3</span>).
  </li>
  <li>Fill in the needed personal information.</li>
  <li>Create your Stripe account.</li>
</ol>

<div class="row">
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card__image">
      <img src={BillingSection} alt="Add payment method to Weaviate Cloud" />
    </div>
    <div class="card__body">
      <p>Add payment method to Weaviate Cloud.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Usage charges

Usage charges reflect the number and size of the objects in your collection. Weaviate polls each collection to determine a daily object count.

- If the objects are uncompressed, the billing system multiplies the object count by the number of dimensions to get the `vectorDimensionsSum`.
- If the objects are compressed, the billing system multiplies the object count by the number of vector segments to get the `vectorSegmentsSum`.

The values are added together and normalized to get a base price. The base price is multiplied by the pricing rate for the cluster's support plan.

:::tip

Significant cost savings can be achieved when **compression** is enabled.

## Support & feedback levels

Weaviate offers [three plans](./support-levels.mdx) with specific support options. Each support plan has a billing rate for usage and a minimum cost per month.

- If the usage cost is less than the monthly minimum charge for the support plan, Weaviate bills the monthly minimum.
- If the usage cost exceeds the monthly minimum, Weaviate bills the minimum amount plus any additional charges.

## High availability

All paid plans include highly available (HA) clusters by default.

## Billing cycles

Charges are calculated and invoiced for active clusters on the 1st day of each month.
