Sandbox clusters are free. You do not need a billing account to create a Sandbox cluster.

Shared Cloud clusters are charged for resource usage. The monthly charge is determined by your usage and your [support plan](https://weaviate.io/support-plans). You have to have a billing account to create a Shared Cloud cluster.

To estimate costs for different usage plans, see the [pricing page](https://weaviate.io/pricing).

:::note

If you have signed up for Weaviate Cloud through an external cloud provider like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ng2dfhb4yjoic) or [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/weaviate-gcp-mktplace/weaviate?inv=1&invt=AbwjlA), the billing will be managed through that cloud provider's marketplace.

## Support & feedback levels

Weaviate offers [multiple support plans at multiple levels](https://weaviate.io/support-plans) with specific support options. Refer to the page for further details.

## High availability

All paid plans include highly available (HA) clusters by default.

## Billing cycles

Charges are calculated and invoiced for active clusters on the 1st day of each month.

## Stop billing & service

To stop billing for your Weaviate Cloud account, delete all active cluster(s). Billing continues for each active cluster until deletion. Each cluster generates a final invoice with your latest usage charges upon deletion.

Once all cluster(s) are deleted and invoices are settled, your subscription will end.
