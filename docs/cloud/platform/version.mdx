[Weaviate Cloud (WCD)](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) hosts clusters that run the Weaviate Database server. Weaviate Cloud runs the current production version of Weaviate Database.

## New clusters

When you provision a new cluster, Weaviate Cloud uses the current version of Weaviate Database to set up the new cluster. You can also choose from a limited number of older versions.

## Upgrade

Weaviate Cloud does not automatically update existing clusters when a new version of Weaviate Database is released.

The Weaviate Cloud console informs you when a newer version is available. Consider your business needs, and [upgrade your cluster](/docs/cloud/platform/version) when you have a suitable maintenance window.

## Security upgrades

 Weaviate Cloud does not automatically update clusters, however if an existing cluster has a security vulnerability, Weaviate Cloud upgrades the cluster when a fix is released.

 For security updates, Weaviate Cloud upgrades the cluster to the most current production release unless there are known compatibility issues. If there are compatibility issues, the cluster is updated to the most recent compatible version.

## Additional considerations

- **Billing**. If your cluster's Weaviate Database version cannot support the billing requirements for your pricing plan, Weaviate Cloud upgrades your cluster to the current production version or the most recent compatible version.
- **Data integrity**. If your cluster's Weaviate Database version has a known risk of data loss or corruption, Weaviate Cloud upgrades the cluster when a fix is released.
- **Downgrade**. You cannot downgrade your cluster to an earlier version of Weaviate Database.
- **Enterprise cloud customers**. If you are an enterprise customer and you require a specific version of Weaviate Database, contact your support representative. In some circumstances, Weaviate Cloud can install a specific Weaviate Database version.
