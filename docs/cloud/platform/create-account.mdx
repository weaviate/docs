## Configure billing information

Sandbox instances are free, short-term instances that expire after 14 days. If you are using a Sandbox instance to try out Weaviate, you don't have to set up billing.

Serverless clusters are persistent instances that are suitable for production, development, and testing. Serverless clusters are paid instances. The cost of each instance depends on the instance type and the support plan you choose. You must configure billing before you can create a Serverless instance. Follow [this guide](/cloud/platform/billing) to set up a billing account.

If you register through a cloud marketplace like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ng2dfhb4yjoic) or [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/weaviate-gcp-mktplace/weaviate?inv=1&invt=AbwjlA), billing will be consolidated through that cloud provider.
