Weaviate Cloud (WCD) offers an interactive console. Create a user account, then login to manage WCD clusters, run queries, and configure your organization details.

## Create a new user account and sign in {#create-a-new-user-account}

Go to the [Weaviate Cloud console](/go/console?utm_content=cloud) and follow the steps below to create a new account and log in.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",

## Configure billing information

Sandbox instances are free, short-term instances that expire after 14 days. If you are using a Sandbox instance to try out Weaviate, you don't have to set up billing.

Shared Cloud clusters are persistent instances that are suitable for production, development, and testing. Shared Cloud clusters are paid instances. The cost of each instance depends on the instance type and the [support plan](https://weaviate.io/support-plans) you choose. You must configure billing before you can create a Shared Cloud instance. Follow [this guide](/cloud/platform/billing) to set up a billing account.

If you register through a cloud marketplace like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ng2dfhb4yjoic) or [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/weaviate-gcp-mktplace/weaviate?inv=1&invt=AbwjlA), billing will be consolidated through that cloud provider.

## Delete user account

This action deletes all clusters, cancels active subscriptions, and removes you from all organizations. WCD automatically processes outstanding invoices and sends a confirmation email within hours. If any invoices remain unpaid, the email will include a link to settle them manually.

To delete your account from Weaviate Cloud (WCD):

1. Remove organization members: If you own an organization, you must remove all other members from it first.
2. Navigate to the [Account Page](https://console.weaviate.cloud/account).
4. In the **Danger Zone** section, click **Delete Account** to permanently remove your account.

If you encounter any issues, please contact our [Weaviate Support](mailto:support@weaviate.io).
