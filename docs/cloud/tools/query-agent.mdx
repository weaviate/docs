The **Weaviate Cloud (WCD) Query Agent** provides and interactive console for using the Weaviate [Query Agent](/docs/agents/query/index.md), a pre-built agentic service designed to answer natural language queries based on the data stored in Weaviate Cloud.

The user simply provides a prompt/question in natural language, and the Query Agent takes care of all intervening steps to provide an answer.

## Query a collection

In order to use the Query Agent, log into your Weaviate Cloud account and select `Agents` in the sidebar panel.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(54.10879629629629% + 50px)",
    height: 0,
  }}
>
  <iframe
    id="dkd5mgyugr"
    src="https://app.guideflow.com/embed/dkd5mgyugr"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    style={{ overflow: "hidden", position: "absolute", border: "none" }}
    scrolling="no"
    allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"
    webkitAllowFullScreen
    mozAllowFullScreen
    allowFullScreen
    allowTransparency="true"
  />
</div>

## Additional parameters for querying

In addition to selecting one or more collections to query, you can also:

- Specify API keys for external model providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Select which vectors in a collection to query (if there are multiple vectors in the collection)
- Specify a _system prompt_ that provides additional information or instructions to the agent (for example, setting the tone, language, etc.)

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(54.10879629629629% + 50px)",
    height: 0,
  }}
>
  <iframe
    id="mk68j60hqp"
    src="https://app.guideflow.com/embed/mk68j60hqp"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    style={{ overflow: "hidden", position: "absolute", border: "none" }}
    scrolling="no"
    allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"
    webkitAllowFullScreen
    mozAllowFullScreen
    allowFullScreen
    allowTransparency="true"
  />
</div>

## Generate code snippets

After executing a query, you can also generate a code snippet that performs the same task through one of the available Weaviate Agents client libraries, either Python or TypeScript.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(54.10879629629629% + 50px)",
    height: 0,
  }}
>
  <iframe
    id="zklz3v9sop"
    src="https://app.guideflow.com/embed/zklz3v9sop"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    style={{ overflow: "hidden", position: "absolute", border: "none" }}
    scrolling="no"
    allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"
    webkitAllowFullScreen
    mozAllowFullScreen
    allowFullScreen
    allowTransparency="true"
  />
</div>
