We love to hear your ideas.

Here are some guidelines for suggesting enhancements. They are designed to make it easier for the maintainers and the community to understand your proposal, which will make it more likely to be adopted.

## Requesting new features

Have an idea for improving Weaviate? We'd love to hear it! You can submit feature requests through either channel:

- **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/labels/feature%20request)** - Create a feature request issue
- **[Community Forum](https://forum.weaviate.io/tag/feature-request)** - Start a discussion with the `feature-request` tag

When submitting a feature request, you should:

- **Check for duplicates** - Search existing requests to avoid duplicates
- **Be clear and specific** - Use a descriptive title and explain what the feature should do
- **Explain the value** - Why would this be useful to Weaviate users?
- **Provide examples** - Include code snippets, use cases, or mockups if helpful

## How to suggest enhancements

Suggestions are tracked as issues in GitHub repositories, such as the [Weaviate repository](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/issues). Check first for a duplicate WIP (work in progress) issue. If not, create an issue in the relevant GitHub repository with the following:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**.
- **A specific and accurate description** of the suggested enhancement; include steps if necessary.
- **Specific examples(s)**. If possible, include code snippets in Markdown format.
- (If relevant) **Describe the current behavior** and then **explain how it would be altered**.
- (If relevant) **Include images, animated GIFs, or video links** in support.
- **Explain why this change would be useful** to Weaviate users.
- Specify which **version of Weaviate** you're using.

## Working on your own ideas

You are welcome to implement your own ideas and contribute code to Weaviate! We love to hear your ideas. Feel free to reach out to us and the wider community on the [forum](https://forum.weaviate.io) to discuss them before you get started.

If you want to implement your ideas, or do some work on the Weaviate code base, follow these [instructions](../weaviate-core/setup.md) to create a local development environment.
