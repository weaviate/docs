Welcome! Working with Weaviate, many of us in the team and the community are exposed to a suite of interesting technologies. They include not only vector databases, but also Docker, Kubernetes, GraphQL, REST and clients in various languages.

This means that is a wide set of opportunities for you to learn about and contribute to! If you are not sure where, we suggest finding something that overlaps with your interests

## How can I contribute?

These are just some of the ways that you could apply your skills to the project:

* [Suggesting Enhancements](./suggesting-enhancements.md)
* [Reporting Bugs](./reporting-bugs.md)

## Where can I contribute to?

There are four major GitHub repositories of Weaviate, any of which you can contribute to. This includes:

* [Weaviate Database](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate) - Weaviate's "core" codebase
* [Weaviate Docs](https://github.com/weaviate/docs) - official Weaviate documentation
* [Weaviate Examples](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-examples) - apps built using Weaviate
* [Awesome Weaviate](https://github.com/weaviate/awesome-weaviate) - list of examples and tutorials on how to use Weaviate

It is important that any contributions such as suggestions or bug reports be made to the correct repository, as they will be otherwise very difficult to understand or integrate.

### Work on existing issues

You can also contribute by working on existing issues. Check the issues pages in Weaviate's GitHub repositories like the [Weaviate Database repository](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/issues). Consider starting with issues tagged '[good first issues](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/labels/good-first-issue)'.
