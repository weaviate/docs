Weaviate instances can be replicated. Replication can improve read throughput, improve availability, and enable zero-downtime upgrades.

For more details on how replication is designed and built in Weaviate, see [Replication Architecture](docs/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture/index.md).

## How to configure

import RaftRFChangeWarning from '/\_includes/1-25-replication-factor.mdx';

<RaftRFChangeWarning/>

Replication is disabled by default. It can be enabled per collection in the [collection configuration](docs/weaviate/manage-collections/multi-node-setup.mdx#replication-settings). This means you can set different replication factors per class in your dataset.

To enable replication, you can set one or both of the following:

- `REPLICATION_MINIMUM_FACTOR` environment variable for the entire Weaviate instance, or
- `replicationFactor` parameter for a collection.

### Weaviate-wide minimum replication factor

The `REPLICATION_MINIMUM_FACTOR` environment variable sets the minimum replication factor for all collections in the Weaviate instance.

If you set the replication factor for a collection, the collection's replication factor overrides the minimum replication factor.


## Data consistency

When Weaviate detects inconsistent data across nodes, it attempts to repair the out of sync data.

Starting in v1.26, Weaviate adds [async replication](docs/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture/consistency.md#async-replication) to proactively detect inconsistencies. In earlier versions, Weaviate uses a [repair-on-read](docs/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture/consistency.md#repair-on-read) strategy to repair inconsistencies at read time.

Repair-on-read is automatic. To activate async replication, set `asyncEnabled` to true in the `replicationConfig` section of your collection definition.

import ReplicationConfigWithAsyncRepair from '/\_includes/code/configuration/replication-consistency.mdx';

### Configure async replication settings {#async-replication-settings}

:::info Added in `v1.29`
The [environment variables](/docs/deploy/config-guides/env-vars/index.md#async-replication) for configuring async replication (`ASYNC_*`) have been introduced in `v1.29`.
:::

Async replication helps achieve consistency for data replicated across multiple nodes.

Update the following [environment variables](/docs/deploy/config-guides/env-vars/index.md#async-replication) to configure async replication for your particular use case.

#### Logging

- **Set the frequency of the logger:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_LOGGING_FREQUENCY`
  Define how often the async replication background process will log events.

#### Data comparison

- **Set the frequency of comparisons:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_FREQUENCY`
  Define how often each node compares its local data with other nodes.
- **Set comparison timeout:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_DIFF_PER_NODE_TIMEOUT`
  Optionally configure a timeout for how long to wait during comparison when a node is unresponsive.
- **Monitor node availability:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_ALIVE_NODES_CHECKING_FREQUENCY`
  Trigger comparisons whenever thereâ€™s a change in node availability.
- **Configure hash tree height:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_HASHTREE_HEIGHT`
  Specify the size of the hash tree, which helps narrow down data differences by comparing hash digests at multiple levels instead of scanning entire datasets. See [this page](docs/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture/consistency.md#memory-and-performance-considerations-for-async-replication) for more information on the memory and performance considerations for async replication.
- **Batch size for digest comparison:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_DIFF_BATCH_SIZE`
  Define the number of objects whose digest (e.g., last update time) is compared between nodes before propagating actual objects.

#### Data synchronization

Once differences between nodes are detected, Weaviate propagates outdated or missing data. Configure synchronization as follows:

- **Set the frequency of propagation:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_FREQUENCY_WHILE_PROPAGATING`
  After synchronization is completed on a node, temporarily adjust the data comparison frequency to the set value.
- **Set propagation timeout:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_PROPAGATION_TIMEOUT`
  Optionally configure a timeout for how long to wait during propagation when a node is unresponsive.
- **Set propagation delay:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_PROPAGATION_DELAY`
  Define a delay period to allow asynchronous write operations to reach all nodes before propagating new or updated objects.
- **Batch size for data propagation:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_PROPAGATION_BATCH_SIZE`
  Define the number of objects that are sent in each synchronization batch during the propagation phase.
- **Set propagation limits:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_PROPAGATION_LIMIT`
  Enforce a limit on the number of out-of-sync objects to be propagated per replication iteration.
- **Set propagation concurrency:** `ASYNC_REPLICATION_PROPAGATION_CONCURRENCY`
  Specify the number of concurrent workers that can send batches of objects to other nodes, allowing multiple propagation batches to be sent simultaneously.

:::tip
Tweak these settings based on your cluster size and network latency to achieve optimal performance. Smaller batch sizes and shorter timeouts may be beneficial for high-traffic clusters, while larger clusters might require more conservative settings.

## How to use: Queries

When you add (write) or query (read) data, one or more replica nodes in the cluster will respond to the request. How many nodes need to send a successful response and acknowledgment to the coordinator node depends on the `consistency_level`. Available [consistency levels](docs/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture/consistency.md) are `ONE`, `QUORUM` (replication_factor / 2 + 1) and `ALL`.

The `consistency_level` can be specified at query time:

```bash
# Get an object by ID, with consistency level ONE
curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/objects/{ClassName}/{id}?consistency_level=ONE"
```

:::note
In v1.17, only [read queries that get data by ID](docs/weaviate/manage-objects/read.mdx#get-an-object-by-id) had a tunable consistency level. All other object-specific REST endpoints (read or write) used the consistency level `ALL`. Starting with v1.18, all write and read queries are tunable to either `ONE`, `QUORUM` (default) or `ALL`. GraphQL endpoints use the consistency level `ONE` (in both versions).
