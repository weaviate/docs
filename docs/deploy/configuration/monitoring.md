Weaviate can expose Prometheus-compatible metrics for monitoring. A standard
Prometheus/Grafana setup can be used to visualize metrics on various
dashboards.

Metrics can be used to measure request latencies, import
speed, time spent on vector vs object storage, memory usage, application usage,
and more.

## Configure Monitoring

### Enable within Weaviate

To tell Weaviate to collect metrics and expose them in a Prometheus-compatible
format, all that's required is to set the following [environment variable](./env-vars/index.md#PROMETHEUS_MONITORING_ENABLED):

```sh
PROMETHEUS_MONITORING_ENABLED=true
```

By default, Weaviate will expose the metrics at `<hostname>:2112/metrics`. You
can optionally change the port to a custom port using the following environment
variable:

```sh
PROMETHEUS_MONITORING_PORT=3456
```

### Scrape metrics from Weaviate

Metrics are typically scraped into a time-series database, such as Prometheus.
How you consume metrics depends on your setup and environment.

The [Weaviate examples repo contains a fully pre-configured setup using
Prometheus, Grafana and some example
dashboards](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-examples/tree/main/monitoring-prometheus-grafana).
You can start up a full-setup including monitoring and dashboards with a single
command. In this setup the following components are used:

- Docker Compose is used to provide a fully-configured setup that can be
  started with a single command.
- Weaviate is configured to expose Prometheus metrics as outlined in the
  section above.
- A Prometheus instance is started with the setup and configured to scrape
  metrics from Weaviate every 15s.
- A Grafana instance is started with the setup and configured to use the
  Prometheus instance as a metrics provider. Additionally, it runs a dashboard
  provider that contains a few sample dashboards.

### Multi-tenancy

When using multi-tenancy, we suggest setting the `PROMETHEUS_MONITORING_GROUP` [environment variable](./env-vars/index.md#PROMETHEUS_MONITORING_GROUP) as `true` so that data across all tenants are grouped together for monitoring.

## Obtainable Metrics

:::info Versioning & breaking changes

Be aware that metrics do not follow the semantic versioning guidelines of other Weaviate features. Weaviate's main APIs are stable and breaking changes are extremely rare. Metrics, however, have shorter feature lifecycles. It can sometimes be necessary to introduce an incompatible change or entirely remove a metric, for example, because the cost of observing a specific metric in production has grown too high. As a result, it is possible that a Weaviate minor release contains a breaking change for the Monitoring system. If so, it will be clearly highlighted in the release notes.

The list of metrics that are obtainable through Weaviate's metric system is constantly being expanded. The complete list of metrics can be found in the source code files: 
- [`usecases/monitoring/prometheus.go`](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/blob/main/usecases/monitoring/prometheus.go)
- [`usecases/replica/metrics.go`](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/blob/main/usecases/replica/metrics.go)
- [`adapters/repos/db/metrics.go`](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/blob/main/adapters/repos/db/metrics.go)
- [`adapters/repos/db/lsmkv/metrics.go`](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/blob/main/adapters/repos/db/lsmkv/metrics.go)
- [`adapters/repos/db/lsmkv/memtable_metrics.go`](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/blob/main/adapters/repos/db/lsmkv/memtable_metrics.go)

This page describes metrics and their uses. Typically metrics are quite granular, as they can always be aggregated later on. For example if the granularity is "shard", you could aggregate all "shard" metrics of the same "class" (collection) to obtain a class metrics, or aggregate all metrics to obtain the metric for the entire Weaviate instance.

<!-- TODO[g-despot] First we need to create this guide for adding metrics - Extending Weaviate with new metrics is very easy. To suggest a new metric, see the [contributor guide](/contributor-guide).-->

## Sample Dashboards

Weaviate does not ship with any dashboards by default, but here is a list of
dashboards being used by the various Weaviate teams, both during development,
and when helping users. These do not come with any support, but may still be
helpful. Treat them as inspiration to design your own dashboards which fit
your uses perfectly:
