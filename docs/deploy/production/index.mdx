# Production Environments

Deploying Weaviate in a production environment requires careful planning to ensure stability, security, and performance. 
Currently, the only supported method of deploying Weaviate in a production environment is through Kubernetes. 
Unlike development or testing environments, a production instance must be resilient, scalable, and optimized for real-world workloads.

## Key Aspects of a Production Environments

- **Scalability and Performance**
    - Production workloads demand high availability and low latency.
    - Auto-scaling strategies and resource monitoring must be in place. 
- **Data Resilience and Backups**
    - Data must be safeguarded against corruption and loss. 
    - Disaster recover strategies and automated backups must be implemented. 
- **Security and Compliance**
    - Data at rest and in transit should be encrypted. 
    - Compliance best practices must be followed.  
- **Monitoring and Observability**
    - Logs and metrics must be collected for troubleshooting and optimization. 
    - Monitoring tools should be used to track performance. 
    - Alerting mechanisms must be set up to detect any anaomolies or failures. 
- **Networking and Access Control**
    - Privileges should be limited using RBAC (role-based access control). 
    - Load balancing should be configured. 

### Weaviate Production Environments

Weaviate has different options for deploying in a production environment using: 

- **Shared Cloud**: A Shared Cloud instance is a robust cluster designed for production use.
- **Dedicated Cloud**: Dedicated Cloud is a fully-managed deployment of dedicated resources within a secure, highly available environment.
