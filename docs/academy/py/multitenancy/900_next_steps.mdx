Congratulations! You have completed this course on multi-tenancy. We hope you found it helpful and informative.

## Multi-tenant collections

Multi-tenant collections are a powerful feature in Weaviate that allow you to manage multiple tenants in a single Weaviate instance. Each tenant has its own isolated data, while sharing the same schema and configuration.

A multi-tenant collection is also much more efficient than creating multiple Weaviate collections. This allows you to scale your application more easily and cost-effectively.

## Multi-tenancy and resource management

While each tenant belongs to a collection and shares the same settings, you can still manage each tenant's resources individually.

This can be done by setting the tenant's state (to `ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE`, or `OFFLOADED`), or setting the index type as `dynamic`, which allows each tenant to only use HNSW once they pass a certain threshold of objects.

A carefully constructed strategy to manage the resources of each tenant can help you optimize your application's performance and cost-effectiveness.
