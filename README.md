## How to build this website

Weaviate uses [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/) to build our
documentation. Docusaurus is a static website generator that runs under
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). We use a Node.js project management tool called
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install Docusaurus and to manage project
dependencies.

If you do not have Node.js and `yarn` installed on your system, install them
first.

### Install Node.js

Use the [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) package manager to install Node.js.
The `nvm` project page provides an [installation script](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating).

After you install `nvm` use it to install Node.js.

```
nvm install
```

By default, `nvm` installs the most recent version of Node.js. Also install the version of Node.js that is specified in `.github/workflows/pull_requests.yaml`. At the time of writing it is version `v22.12.0`.

```
nvm install 22
nvm use 22
```

### Install yarn

Node.js includes the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager. Use `npm`
to install `yarn`.

```
npm install --global yarn
```

### Update Dependencies

Once you have a local copy of the repository, you need to install Docusaurus and
the other project dependencies.

Switch to the project directory, then use yarn to update the dependencies.

```
yarn install
```

You may see some warnings during the installation.

### Local Development

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

```
yarn start
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ showing the local build. If you close the terminal, the server will stop. Or press `Ctrl+C`/`Cmd+C` to stop the server.

### Build the Web Site

This command generates static content into the `build` directory. You can use
a hosting service to serve the static content.

```
yarn build
```

The `build` command is useful when you are finished editing. If you ran
`yarn start` to start a local web server, you do not need to use `yarn build` to
see you changes while you are editing.

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
