If you prefer a different model provider integration, or prefer to import your own vectors, see one of the following guides:

import CardsSection from "/src/components/CardsSection";
import styles from "/src/components/CardsSection/styles.module.scss";

export const specificGuidesData = [
  {
    title: "Prefer a different model provider?",
    description:
      "See the embedding model providers page for information on other available vectorizers, such as AWS, Cohere, Google, and many more.",
    link: "/weaviate/model-providers",
    icon: "fas fa-puzzle-piece", // Icon representing data management
  },
  {
    title: "You have precomputed embeddings?",
    description:
      "If you prefer to add custom vectors yourself along with the object data, see the Bring Your Own Vectors starter guide.",
    link: "/weaviate/starter-guides/custom-vectors",
    icon: "fas fa-project-diagram", // Icon representing vector relationships/structure
  },
];

<CardsSection items={specificGuidesData} className={styles.smallCards}/>
