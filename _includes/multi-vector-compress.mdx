Multi-vector embeddings (implemented through models like ColBERT, ColPali, or ColQwen) represent each object or query using multiple vectors instead of a single vector. Just like with single vectors, multi-vectors support [PQ](/weaviate/configuration/compression/pq-compression), [BQ](/weaviate/configuration/compression/bq-compression), [RQ](/weaviate/configuration/compression/rq-compression), [SQ](/weaviate/configuration/compression/sq-compression), or no compression.

During the initial search phase, compressed vectors are used for efficiency. However, when computing the `MaxSim` operation, uncompressed vectors are utilized to ensure more precise similarity calculations. This approach balances the benefits of compression for search efficiency with the accuracy of uncompressed vectors during final scoring.
