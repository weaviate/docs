:::warning Replication factor change

The replication factor of a collection cannot be updated by updating the collection's definition. 

From `v1.32` by using [replica movement](/deploy/configuration/replica-movement), the [replication factor](/docs/weaviate/config-refs/schema/index.md#replicationconfig) of a shard can be changed.
