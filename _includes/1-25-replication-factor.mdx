:::warning Replication factor change
The replication factor of a collection cannot be updated by updating the collection's definition. 

From `v1.32` by using [replica movement](/deploy/configuration/replica-movement), the [replication factor](/weaviate/config-refs/collections#replication) of a shard can be changed.
