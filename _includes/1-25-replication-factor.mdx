:::warning Replication factor change
Currently (from `v1.25.0` onwards) a [replication factor](/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture/cluster-architecture#replication-factor) cannot be changed once it is set.

This is due to the [schema consensus algorithm](/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture/consistency) change in `v1.25`. This will be improved in future versions.
