Collections can have multiple [named vectors](/weaviate/config-refs/collections#named-vectors). The vectors in a collection can have their own configurations, and compression must be enabled independently for each vector. Every vector is independent and can use [PQ](/weaviate/configuration/compression/pq-compression), [BQ](/weaviate/configuration/compression/bq-compression), [RQ](/weaviate/configuration/compression/rq-compression), [SQ](/weaviate/configuration/compression/sq-compression), or no compression.
