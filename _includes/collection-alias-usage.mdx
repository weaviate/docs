:::info Collection alias usage

Weaviate automatically routes alias requests to the target collection for **object-related operations**. You can use aliases wherever collection names are required for:

- **[Managing objects](/weaviate/manage-objects)**: [Create](/weaviate/manage-objects/create), [batch import](/weaviate/manage-objects/import), [read](/weaviate/manage-objects/read), [update](/weaviate/manage-objects/update) and [delete](/weaviate/manage-objects/delete) objects through collection aliases.
- **[Querying objects](/weaviate/search)**: [Fetch](/weaviate/search/basics) objects and perform searches ([vector](/weaviate/search/similarity), [keyword](/weaviate/search/bm25), [hybrid](/weaviate/search/hybrid), [image](/weaviate/search/image), [generative/RAG](/weaviate/search/generative)) and [aggregations](/weaviate/search/aggregate) through aliases.
