The Query Agent makes use of each collection's `description` metadata as well as individual property descriptions in deciding what collection to query.

Both collection descriptions and property descriptions can be updated after the collection has been created. For detailed instructions on updating collection and property descriptions, see the [update collection definition documentation](/weaviate/manage-collections/collection-operations#update-a-collection-definition).

We are investigating an ability to specify a custom collection description at runtime.
