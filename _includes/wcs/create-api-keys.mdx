When connecting to a Weaviate Cloud cluster, you need an API key and the REST endpoint URL for authentication.

If you don't have an existing API key, you'll need to create one. Follow these steps to find the API keys section and create a new key if necessary:

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(54.10879629629629% + 50px)",
    height: 0,
  }}
>
  <iframe
    id="ok8l954sxr"
    src="https://app.guideflow.com/embed/ok8l954sxr"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    style={{ overflow: "hidden", position: "absolute", border: "none" }}
    scrolling="no"
    allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"
    webKitAllowFullScreen
    mozAllowFullScreen
    allowFullScreen
    allowTransparency="true"
  />
  <script
    src="https://app.guideflow.com/assets/opt.js"
    data-iframe-id="ok8l954sxr"
  ></script>
</div>

<summary>Steps to create a new API key</summary>

1.  Open the [Weaviate Cloud console](https://console.weaviate.cloud) and [select your cluster](https://www.google.com/search?q=/cloud/manage-clusters/status%23select-your-cluster).
2.  Navigate to the `API Keys` section, found in the `Cluster details` panel.
3.  If you need a new API key, click the `Create API key` button.
4.  In the `Create API Key` form, provide a descriptive name for your key.
5.  Choose the role for this API key. You can either select an existing role like `admin` or `viewer`, or [create a new role](https://www.google.com/search?q=/cloud/manage-clusters/authorization) with specific permissions.
6.  Click the `Create` button.
7.  **Important:** This is the only time your API key will be displayed. Make sure to copy it or download it and store it in a secure location immediately after creation. You will not be able to retrieve the full key again.
