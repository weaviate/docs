:::info Compression by Default

Starting with `v1.33`, you can set a default quantization for new collections using the [`DEFAULT_QUANTIZATION`](/deploy/configuration/env-vars#DEFAULT_QUANTIZATION) environment variable. This variable is not set by default, meaning no quantization is applied unless you explicitly configure it. When set (e.g., to 8-bit [RQ quantization](/weaviate/configuration/compression/rq-compression)), all newly created collections will use that quantization setting. Note that once set on a collection, quantization can't be disabled. Default quantization only applies for the HNSW vector index type.
