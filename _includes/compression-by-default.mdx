:::info Compression by Default

Starting with `v1.33`, Weaviate enables **8-bit [RQ quantization](/weaviate/configuration/compression/rq-compression) by default** when creating new collections to ensure efficient resource utilization and faster performance. This behavior can be changed through the [`DEFAULT_QUANTIZATION`](/deploy/configuration/env-vars#DEFAULT_QUANTIZATION) environment variable. Note that once enabled, quantization can't be disabled for a collection.
