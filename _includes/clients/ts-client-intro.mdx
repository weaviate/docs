The TypeScript client supports code that is written in TypeScript or JavaScript.

The **v3 client** is the current TypeScript client. If you have code written for the v2 client, you should [migrate it to v3](/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/v2_v3_migration) as the v2 client is no longer maintained.

:::note

The v3 client supports server side development (Node.js hosted). If your application is browser based, you might consider using the [TypeScript client v2](/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v2). Keep in mind that the v2 client is outdated and no longer officially maintained.
