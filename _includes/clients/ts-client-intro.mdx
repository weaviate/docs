The TypeScript client supports code that is written in TypeScript or JavaScript.

The **v3 client** is the current TypeScript client. If you have code written for the [v2 client](/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript#javascripttypescript-client-v2-deprecation), you should migrate it to v3 as the v2 client is no longer maintained.

:::note

The v3 client supports server side development (Node.js hosted). If your application is browser based, you might consider using the [TypeScript client v2](/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript#javascripttypescript-client-v2-deprecation). Keep in mind that the v2 client is outdated and no longer officially maintained.
