The TypeScript client supports code that is written in TypeScript or JavaScript.

The **v3 client** is the current TypeScript client. If you have code written for the v2 client, you should migrate it to v3 as it will become deprecated at some point.

The v3 client supports server side development (Node.js hosted). If your application is browser based, you might consider using the [TypeScript client v2](/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v2).
