:::caution .Vectors.text2vec_xxx with AutoSchema
If using Python client library `4.16.0`-`4.16.3`, defining a collection with `Configure.Vectors.text2vec_xxx()` may throw an error if no properties are defined and `vectorize_collection_name` is not set to `True`.

This is addressed in `4.16.4` of the Weaviate Python client. See this FAQ entry for more details: [Invalid properties error in Python client versions 4.16.0 to 4.16.3](/weaviate/more-resources/faq#q-invalid-properties-error-when-creating-a-collection-python-client-versions-4160-to-4163).
