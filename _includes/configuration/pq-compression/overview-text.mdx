[**Product quantization (PQ)**](/weaviate/concepts/vector-quantization#product-quantization) is a form of data compression for vectors. PQ reduces the HNSW index's memory footprint so you can work with larger datasets. For a discussion of how PQ saves memory, see [Product quantization](/weaviate/concepts/vector-quantization#product-quantization).
