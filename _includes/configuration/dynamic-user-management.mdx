:::tip TIP: User management API available from `v1.30`

Instead of adding additional users via the `AUTHENTICATION_APIKEY_USERS` environment variable, we suggest using the [user management API](/docs/weaviate/configuration/rbac/manage-users) which you can use to create and delete users, manage their roles and rotate their API keys.
